# Explore evidence for hypotheses in invasion science

This is an R shiny app synthesizing literature information on 10 major hypotheses in invasion science. 
The dataset consists in metadata and content annotations for >1000 scientific studies reviewed by various authors for a book edited by Jeshcke & Heger (2018).
The data was later curated in the ORKG (open research knowledge graph; [https://orkg.org]) as a sequence of 10 literature comparisons (https://orkg.org/search/invasion?types=Comparison).

This R shiny app first cleans and assembles the data table extracted from ORKG. The app proposes a series of interactive visualizations, providing an overview of the level of support for the hypotheses and how this is distributed over time, habitats, taxa, continents and methods. 

The app proposes to filter the dataset based on:
1) the hypothesis
2) studied invasive taxonomic groups
3) habitats (i.e. terrestrial, freshwater, marine, other)
4) research method (i.e. observational or experimental)
