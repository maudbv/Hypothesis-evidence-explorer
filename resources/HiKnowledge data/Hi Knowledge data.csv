Patterns of plant invasions in the preserves and recreation areas of Shei-Pa National Park in Taiwan/Contribution 1","Patterns of plant invasions in the preserves and recreation areas of Shei-Pa National Park in Taiwan","Terrestrial","Plants",NA,NA,"Number of exotic species",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"different levels of anthropogenic activities, distance to roads ( e.g. recreation areas, conservation area)  (national park)","Others","Yes",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Patterns of plant invasions in the preserves and recreation areas of Shei-Pa National Park in Taiwan","None","Nature preserves in the national parks are usually adjacent to the recreation areas, where most of the tourists visit. Although permits are required and only few small trials are available to enter the preserves, species naturalized in the neighboring recreation areas may hitchhike across the borders. To estimate the differences of plant invasions in neighboring preserves and recreation areas experiencing different intensity of anthropogenic activities, we employed Wuling district (alt. 1,800-3,860 m), Shei-Pa National Park in Taiwan as our study site. Our hypotheses were: (1) the recreation areas harbor more naturalized species, and plant invasion patterns are different in these areas under various land management strategies; (2) species inhabiting the preserves could be found in the recreation areas as well; (3) naturalized species of temperate origins are dominant due to the temperate weather in the mountains. Total of 230 quadrats in one meter square quadrats were randomly selected along the roads and trails in both areas. Naturalized species, relative cover, elevation, and naturalness degree were obtained and analyzed. The results showed that the naturalized species in both areas were herbaceous, originating from tropical and temperate Americas and Europe. Naturalized floras of these two areas were presented by analogous dominant families, Asteraceae and Poaceae, and dominant species, Bromus catharticus and Trifolium repens. However, the number and coverage of naturalized species, a diversity, elevation, and naturalness degree, suggested different patterns of plant invasions of these two areas. Recreation areas accommodated significantly more naturalized species and higher coverage, and elevation was responsible for distinct patterns of plant invasions. Both of the preserves and recreation areas in Wuling provided suitable habitats for similar naturalized floras; however, relatively more species harbored by the later implied a source and sink relationships between these two areas. Furthermore, environmental factors that change with the elevation, such as temperature, topography, and native vegetation, may contribute to different patterns of plant invasions presented by preserves and the recreation areas in the subtropical mountains."

In urban areas, richer in alien species than other areas, the risk of invasion is higher than elsewhere. The richness of both alien and native woody plants in urban riparian areas allows examination of the relationship between native and alien species richness, which has not been previously done for woody species as a separate guild. The aims of study were to compare current flora of woody species to that from the 1980s and to test whether the hypothesis of biotic acceptance can explain richness of alien woody species. The study was conducted in the Warta River Valley in Poznan city (Poland). During field work we compiled lists of woody species in 31 grid squares (1 km x 1 km). Regression analysis was used to examine the relationship between number of native and alien woody plant species. From the 1980s to 2013, the number of woody species increased from 76 to 116. The share of alien species also increased from 29.3% to 45.7%. We found a positive relationship between richness of alien and native woody species, which explains 46% of variance. The abundance of the most successful invaders is connected with high initial propagule pressure from the high number of alien ornamental species in urban green areas. The positive relationship between number of native and alien woody species shows the wider base of ""the rich get richer"" concept, so treated separately, woody species may be determinants of dynamic processes in vegetation. Due to recent manifestations of invasive potential of some species, their invasion probability may be underestimated. Therefore, alien species should be avoided in urban green areas near natural and semi-natural urban forests, especially riparian forests, which are vulnerable to biological invasion.

Populations from the species' native range (Mozambique) are compared to a population from New Caledonia (Wester Pacific), an island where the species was introduced in 1954. The results support the complete local extinction of the gill parasite community in the course of the invasion process. Up to six gill parasite species per locality were documented in the O. mossambicus native range, and previous surveys consistently reported at least one parasite species introduced along African cichlid species established out of Africa. The absence of parasites in New Caledonia is therefore exceptional. This can be attributed to local factors, such as a strong initial population bottleneck, the likely absence of multiple host introductions, and the frequent occurrence of brackish watersheds that might enhance the probability for natural deparasitation."

This suggestion has attracted considerable ecological interest and several theoretical mechanisms have been proposed. However, few data are available to test the hypotheses directly, and the pattern may simply result from many more species being transported to islands rather than mainland regions. Here I test this idea using data for global land birds and present evidence that introductions to islands have a higher probability of success than those to mainland regions. This difference between island and mainland landforms is not consistent among either taxonomic families or biogeographic regions. Instead, introduction attempts within the same biogeographic region have been significantly more successful than those that have occurred between two different biogeographic regions. Subsequently, the proportion of introduction attempts that have occurred within a single biogeographic region is thus a significant predictor of the observed variability in introduction success. I also show that the correlates of successful island introductions are probably different to those of successful mainland introductions."

We tested whether the three exotic plant species, Rubus phoenicolasius (wineberry), Fallopia japonica (Japanese knotweed), and Persicaria perfoliata (mile-a-minute weed), suffered less herbivory or pathogen attack than native species by comparing leaf damage and invertebrate herbivore abundance and diversity on the invasive species and their native congeners. Fallopia japonica and R. phoenicolasius received less leaf damage than their native congeners, and F. japonica also contained a lower diversity and abundance of invertebrate herbivores. If the observed decrease in damage experienced by these two plant species contributes to increased fitness, then escape from enemies may provide at least a partial explanation for their invasiveness. However, P. perfoliata actually received greater leaf damage than its native congener. Rhinoncomimus latipes, a weevil previously introduced in the United States as a biological control for P. perfoliata, accounted for the greatest abundance of insects collected from P. perfoliata. Therefore, it is likely that the biocontrol R. latipes was responsible for the greater damage on P. perfoliata, suggesting this insect may be effective at controlling P. perfoliata populations if its growth and reproduction is affected by the increased herbivore damage."

Moreover, invasive populations showed a reduced incidence of parasitizing insects suggesting that enemy release may play a role in the success of this invader. We also found that among-population variation in seed mass was significantly reduced in European population, implying that the species underwent a population bottleneck when introduced to Europe. These first results will serve as a starting point for further studies on the influence of herbivory in this invasive species."

The aims of the study are to test the hypothesis that urbanization results in uniformity of urban floras, and to evaluate the role of alien species in the flora of settlements located in different phytoclimatic regions. To obtain comparable data, ten plots of 1 ha, each representing typical urban habitats, were analysed in each city. The results indicate a low floristic similarity between the cities, while the strongest similarity appears within each city and between each city and the seminatural vegetation of the surrounding region. In the Mediterranean settlements, even the most urbanized plots reflect the characters of the surrounding landscape and are rich in native species, while aliens are relatively few. These results differ from the reported uniformity and the high proportion of aliens which generally characterize urban floras elsewhere. To explain this trend the importance of apophytes (indigenous plants expanding into man-made habitats) is highlighted; several Mediterranean species adapted to disturbance (i.e. grazing, trampling, and human activities) are pre-adapted to the urban environment. In addition, consideration is given to the minor role played by the 'urban heat island' in the Mediterranean basin, and to the structure and history of several Italian settlements, where ancient walls, ruins and archaeological sites in the periphery as well as in the historical centres act as conservative habitats and provide connection with seed-sources on the outskirts."

Most studies of this kind have found significant correlations between latitude and various plant traits, usually using univariate analytic methods. However, plants are composed of multiple, interacting traits, and it is this correlation among traits that can affect how quickly or even whether the populations of invasive plants adapt to their local climatic conditions. We used data from a common garden experiment to determine the possible formation of latitudinal clines in invasive North American populations of Lythrum salicaria L. (purple loosestrife) from the central portion of its invasive range. Analyses were conducted using the more common univariate approach (nested and oneway ANOVAs; linear regression) on individual plant traits (e.g., time to flowering, plant height, various mass measures, and growth rate) and then a multivariate approach (principle components analysis followed by redundancy analysis). Significant among-population differences (P < 0.01) were noted when using both the nested and oneway ANOVAs, and multivariate techniques. However, there were no significant relationships between individual plants traits to latitude when using linear regressions, most likely as a result of the small number of populations used in the study (n = 4). On the contrary, the multivariate analyses showed a significant effect of latitude (P < 0.001) on the invasive populations, but this explained only 4% of the variance; latitude explained 8% of the variance when both invasive and native populations were analyzed. Because of the integrated nature of plant phenotypes, a multivariate approach should provide a clearer and deeper understanding of population responses to changing conditions than univariate techniques."

It has been introduced to North America where it has often established dense stands in both secondary woodlands and relatively undisturbed mature woodlands. In Europe A. platanoides is also extending its original range, but generally seems to exist at much lower densities. One explanation for the 'aggressiveness' of invasive plants such as A. platanoides is that they have left behind pests and diseases which limit their population densities in their native lands (the enemy release hypothesis or ERH). To assess the ERH for Norway maple, a large network of collaborators assessed leaf herbivory rates in populations throughout Europe and North America. We found significantly lower total leaf herbivory (1.6% +/- A 0.19, n = 21 vs. 7.4% +/- A 1.94, n = 34) and lower fungal damage (1.0% +/- A 0.35, n = 13 vs. 3.7% +/- A 0.85, n = 34) in North America than in Europe over a 2 year period, which is consistent with the predictions of the Enemy Release Hypothesis. Across years, the average total leaf herbivory was significantly correlated with average annual temperature of the site (P < 0.05), although this was mostly due to sites in Europe (P < 0.001), and not sites in North America (P > 0.05). Furthermore, only populations in Europe showed very high levels of herbivory (e.g., nine sites had total leaf herbivory ranging from 10.0 to 51.2% in at least 1 year) or leaf fungal damage (only one site in North America showed high levels of fungal damage in 1 year), suggesting the possibility of more frequent episodic outbreaks in the native range. Leaf herbivory and fungal damage are only two aspects of consumer pressure and we do not know whether the differences reported here are enough to actually elicit release from top-down population control, but such large scale biogeographic differences in herbivory contribute towards understanding exotic invasions."

Although direct and indirect interactions between exotic species have been well documented for plant-herbivore interactions, the majority of studies have focused on a single interaction and on plant rather than herbivore performance. In this study we investigated whether invasive exotic plants could contribute to the invasion of California by an exotic generalist herbivore (Epiphyas postvittana). We tested this expectation in the greenhouse by monitoring the performance of larval and pupal stages of E. postvittana on six pairs of congeneric invasive and native plants. Larval survivorship and pupal weight of E. postvittana were both greater on the invasive species, and larval development time was shorter on the invasive plant species for two of the plant genera. Our results suggest that prior invasion of exotic plants could function as a catalyst for the subsequent invasion of an exotic insect herbivore, at least in the case where they have shared some history, thereby accelerating the invasion process and expansion of its novel geographic range."

This scoring can be used to identify the most harmful alien species so that conservation measures to ameliorate their negative effects can be prioritized. For all alien mammals in Europe, we assessed impact reports as completely as possible. Impact was classified as either environmental or economic. We subdivided each of these categories into five subcategories (environmental: impact through competition, predation, hybridization, transmission of disease, and herbivory; economic: impact on agriculture, livestock, forestry, human health, and infrastructure). We assigned all impact reports to one of these 10 categories. All categories had impact scores that ranged from zero (minimal) to five (maximal possible impact at a location). We summed all impact scores for a species to calculate ""potential impact"" scores. We obtained ""actual impact"" scores by multiplying potential impact scores by the percentage of area occupied by the respective species in Europe. Finally, we correlated species' ecological traits with the derived impact scores. Alien mammals from the orders Rodentia, Artiodactyla, and Carnivora caused the highest impact. In particular, the brown rat (Rattus norvegicus), muskrat (Ondathra zibethicus), and sika deer (Cervus nippon) had the highest overall scores. Species with a high potential environmental impact also had a strong potential economic impact. Potential impact also correlated with the distribution of a species in Europe. Ecological flexibility (measured as number of different habitats a species occupies) was strongly related to impact. The scoring system was robust to uncertainty in knowledge of impact and could be adjusted with weight scores to account for specific value systems of particular stakeholder groups (e.g., agronomists or environmentalists). Finally, the scoring system is easily applicable and adaptable to other taxonomic groups."

We provide the first global meta-analysis of the ecological effects of nonnative crayfish under experimental settings to compare effects among species and across levels of ecological organization. Our meta-analysis revealed strong, but variable, negative ecological impacts of nonnative crayfish with strikingly consistent effects among introduced species. In experimental settings, nonnative crayfish generally affect all levels of freshwater food webs. Nonnative crayfish reduce the abundance of basal resources like aquatic macrophytes, prey on invertebrates like snails and mayflies, and reduce abundances and growth of amphibians and fish, but they do not consistently increase algal biomass. Nonnative crayfish tend to have larger positive effects on growth of algae and larger negative effects on invertebrates and fish than native crayfish, but effect sizes vary considerably. Our study supports the assessment of crayfish as strong interactors in food webs that have significant effects across native taxa via polytrophic, generalist feeding habits. Nonnative crayfish species identity may be less important than extrinsic attributes of the recipient ecosystems in determining effects of nonnative crayfish. We identify some understudied and emerging nonnative crayfish that should be studied further and suggest expanding research to encompass more comparisons of native vs nonnative crayfish and different geographic regions. The consistent and general negative effects of nonnative crayfish warrant efforts to discourage their introduction beyond native ranges."

In many regions, introduced species richness increases supralinearly over time. This does not, however, necessarily indicate increasing introduction rates or invasion success. We develop a simple null model to identify the expected trend in invasion records over time. For constant introduction rates and success, the expected trend is exponentially increasing. Model extensions with varying introduction rate and success can also generate exponential distributions. We then analyse temporal trends in aquatic, marine and terrestrial invasion records. Most data sets support an exponential distribution (15/16) and the null invasion model (12/16). Thus, our model shows that no change in introduction rate or success need be invoked to explain the majority of observed trends. Further, an exponential trend does not necessarily indicate increasing invasion success or 'invasional meltdown', and a saturating trend does not necessarily indicate decreasing success or biotic resistance."

The flora of the island was sampled extensively and the phylogeny of the local community was reconstructed using the two core DNA barcode regions, rbcLa and matK. By analysing the phylogenetic patterns of native and invasive floras at two different scales, we found that invasive alien species are more distantly related to native species, a confirmation of Darwin's naturalization hypothesis. However, this pattern also holds even for randomly generated communities, therefore discounting the explanatory power of Darwin's naturalization hypothesis as the unique driver of invasion success on the island.

In large part, these studies have emerged from analyses of historical records from a single place-New Zealand. Here we raise two concerns about these conclusions. First, we argue that although many bird species were introduced repeatedly to New Zealand, in many cases the introductions apparently occurred only after the species were already successfully naturalized. The inclusion of such seemingly superfluous introductions may exaggerate the importance of propagule pressure. And second, we question the reliability of the records themselves. In many cases these records are equivocal, as inconsistencies appear in separate studies of the same records. Our analysis indicates that species were successful not because they were introduced frequently and in high numbers, but rather it is likely that they were introduced frequently and in high numbers because the initial releases were successful."

While the identities and distributions of coinvasive fungal symbionts of pine invasions are poorly known, communities that have been studied are notably depauperate. However, it is not yet clear whether any number of fungal coinvaders is able to support a Pinaceae invasion, or whether very depauperate communities are unable to invade. Here, we ask whether there is evidence for a minimum species richness of fungal symbionts necessary to support a pine/ectomycorrhizal fungus coinvasion. We sampled a Pinus contorta invasion front near Coyhaique, Chile, using molecular barcoding to identify ectomycorrhizal fungi. We report that the site has a total richness of four species, and that many invasive trees appear to be supported by only a single ectomycorrhizal fungus, Suillus luteus.

We used generalized linear models to investigate how muskrat presence related to beaver-modified habitats on Navarino Island, Chile. We also investigated the trophic interactions of the mink with muskrats and beavers by studying mink diet. Additionally, we proposed a conceptual species interaction framework involving these invasive species on the new terrestrial community. Our results indicated a positive association between muskrat presence and beaver-modified habitats. Model average coefficients indicated that muskrats preferred beaver-modified freshwater ecosystems, compared to not dammed naturally flowing streams. In addition, mammals and fish represented the main prey items for mink. Although fish were mink's dominant prey in marine coastal habitats, muskrats represented >50 % of the biomass of mink diet in inland environments. We propose that beavers affect river flow and native vegetation, changing forests into wetlands with abundant grasses and rush vegetation. Thus, beavers facilitate the existence of muskrats, which in turn sustain inland mink populations. The latter have major impacts on the native biota, especially on native birds and small rodents. The facilitative interactions among beavers, muskrats, and mink that we explored in this study, together with other non-native species, suggest that an invasive meltdown process may exist; however further research is needed to confirm this hypothesis. Finally, we propose a community-level management to conserve the biological integrity of native ecosystems."

In this experiment, I manipulated the functional group richness and composition of a grassland community to test two related hypotheses: (1) Diversity and invasion resistance are positively related through diversity's effects on the resources necessary for invading plants' growth. (2) Plant communities resist invasion by species in functional groups already present in the community. To test these hypotheses, I removed plant functional groups (forbs, C3 graminoids, and C4 graminoids) from existing grassland vegetation to create communities that contained all possible combinations of one, two, or three functional groups. After three years of growth, I added seeds of 16 different native prairie species (legumes, nonleguminous forbs, C3 graminoids, and C4 graminoids) to a1 3 1 m portion of each 4 3 8 m plot. Overall invasion success was negatively related to resident functional group richness, but there was only weak evidence that resident species repelled functionally similar invaders. A weak effect of functional group richness on some resources did not explain the significant diversity-invasibility relationship. Other factors, particularly the different responses of resident functional groups to the initial disturbance of the experimental manipulation, seem to have been more important to community in- vasibility."

These fungi comprise a considerable portion of global biodiversity and fulfill important ecological functions. Many species and their host spectra are known only insufficiently. Botanic gardens are particularly well suited for studying these fungi due to the variety of potential hosts and the likely fungal introductions via the exchange of plant material between gardens. The enemy-release hypothesis (ERH), which predicts that exotic species tend to be successful in their introduced range because they leave behind their natural enemies, is particularly relevant for botanic gardens, given their cultivation of many neophytes. This study examined whether the neophytes of three selected plant families (Asteraceae, Betulaceae and Rosaceae) in the Ecological-Botanical Gardens (EBG), Bayreuth, Germany, are less frequently infected by parasitic micromycetes than native plant species of the same family. Native plant species of all three families were significantly more often infected by micromycetes than neophytes, strongly supporting the ERH. Remarkably, neophytes were more frequently infected by native micromycetes than by neomycetes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on micromycetes in a botanical garden to examine the ERH. Botanic gardens provide a test for ecological theory that deserves more research also by mycologists and invasion biologists."

Successful invaders must tolerate abiotic conditions and overcome resistance from native species in invaded habitats. Biotic resistance to invasions may reflect the diversity, abundance, or identity of species in a community. Few studies, however, have examined the relative importance of abiotic and biotic factors determining community invasibility. In a greenhouse experiment, we simulated the abiotic and biotic gradients typically found in vernal pools to better understand their impacts on invasibility. Specifically, we invaded plant communities differing in richness, identity, and abundance of native plants ( the ""plant neighborhood'') and depth of inundation to measure their effects on growth, reproduction, and survival of five exotic plant species. Inundation reduced growth, reproduction, and survival of the five exotic species more than did plant neighborhood. Inundation reduced survival of three species and growth and reproduction of all five species. Neighboring plants reduced growth and reproduction of three species but generally did not affect survival. Brassica rapa, Centaurea solstitialis, and Vicia villosa all suffered high mortality due to inundation but were generally unaffected by neighboring plants. In contrast, Hordeum marinum and Lolium multi forum, whose survival was unaffected by inundation, were more impacted by neighboring plants. However, the four measures describing plant neighborhood differed in their effects. Neighbor abundance impacted growth and reproduction more than did neighbor richness or identity, with growth and reproduction generally decreasing with increasing density and mass of neighbors. Collectively, these results suggest that abiotic constraints play the dominant role in determining invasibility along vernal pool and similar gradients. By reducing survival, abiotic constraints allow only species with the appropriate morphological and physiological traits to invade. In contrast, biotic resistance reduces invasibility only in more benign environments and is best predicted by the abundance, rather than diversity, of neighbors. These results suggest that stressful environments are not likely to be invaded by most exotic species. However, species, such as H. marinum, that are able to invade these habitats require careful management, especially since these environments often harbor rare species and communities."

As requested by scientists and managers, our study aims at understanding the population ecology of mink in order to respond to conservation concerns. We studied the abundance of mink in different semi-aquatic habitats using live trapping (n = 1,320 trap nights) and sign surveys (n = 68 sites). With generalized linear models we evaluated mink abundance in relation to small-scale habitat features including habitats engineered by invasive beavers (Castor canadensis). Mink have colonized the entire island and signs were found in 79% of the surveys in all types of semi-aquatic habitats. Yet, relative population abundance (0.75 mink/km of coastline) was still below densities measured in other invaded or native areas. The habitat model accuracies indicated that mink were generally less specific in habitat use, probably due to the missing limitations normally imposed by predators or competitors. The selected models predicted that mink prefer to use shrubland instead of open habitat, coastal areas with heterogeneous shores instead of flat beaches, and interestingly, that mink avoid habitats strongly modified by beavers. Our results indicate need for immediate mink control on Navarino Island. For this future management we suggest that rocky coastal shores should be considered as priority sites deserving special conservation efforts. Further research is needed with respect to the immigration of mink from adjacent islands and to examine facilitating or hampering relationships between the different invasive species present, especially if integrative management is sought."

Nevertheless, several components of this hypothesis, including the role of generalist herbivores, remain relatively unexplored. We used repeated censuses of exclosures and paired controls to investigate the role of a generalist herbivore, white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), in the invasion of 3 exotic plant species (Microstegium vimineum, Alliaria petiolata, and Berberis thunbergii) in eastern hemlock ( Tsuga canadensis) forests in New Jersey and Pennsylvania ( U. S. A.). This work was conducted in 10 eastern hemlock ( T. canadensis) forests that spanned gradients in deer density and in the severity of canopy disturbance caused by an introduced insect pest, the hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae). We used maximum likelihood estimation and information theoretics to quantify the strength of evidence for alternative models of the influence of deer density and its interaction with the severity of canopy disturbance on exotic plant abundance. Our results were consistent with the enemy release hypothesis in that exotic plants gained a competitive advantage in the presence of generalist herbivores in the introduced range. The abundance of all 3 exotic plants increased significantly more in the control plots than in the paired exclosures. For all species, the inclusion of canopy disturbance parameters resulted in models with substantially greater support than the deer density only models. Our results suggest that white-tailed deer herbivory can accelerate the invasion of exotic plants and that canopy disturbance can interact with herbivory to magnify the impact. In addition, our results provide compelling evidence of nonlinear relationships between deer density and the impact of herbivory on exotic species abundance. These findings highlight the important role of herbivore density in determining impacts on plant abundance and provide evidence of the operation of multiple mechanisms in exotic plant invasion."

It has also been predicted that current and future climate change will favour alien over indigenous species as a consequence of more favourable responses to warming in the former. It is therefore surprising that little is known about the environmental physiology of sub-Antarctic springtails and that few studies have explicitly tested the hypothesis that invasive species will outperform indigenous ones under warmer conditions. Here we present thermal tolerance data on three invasive (Pogonognathellus flavescens, Isotomurus cf. palustris, Ceratophysella denticulata) and two indigenous (Cryptopygus antarcticus, Tullbergia bisetosa) species of springtails from Marion Island, explicitly testing the idea that consistent differences exist between the indigenous and invasive species both in their absolute limits and the ways in which they respond to acclimation (at temperatures from 0 to 20 degrees C). Phenotypic plasticity is the first in a series of ways in which organisms might respond to altered environments. Using a poorly explored, but highly appropriate technique, we demonstrate that in these species the crystallization temperature (T-c) is equal to the lower lethal temperature. We also show that cooling rate (I degrees C min(-1); 0.1 degrees C min(-1); 0.5 degrees C h(-1) from 5 to -1 degrees C followed by 0.1 degrees C min(-1)) has little effect on Tc. The indigenous species typically have low T(c)s (c. -20 to - 13 degrees C depending on the acclimation temperature), whilst those of the invasive species tend to be higher (c. - 12 to - 6 degrees C) at the lower acclimation temperatures. However, Ceratophysella denticulata is an exception with a low T-c (c. -20 to - 18 degrees C), and in P. flavescens acclimation to 20 degrees C results in a pronounced decline in T-c. In general, the invasive and alien species do not differ substantially in acclimation effects on T-c (with the exception of the strong response in P. flavescens). Upper lethal temperatures (ULT50) are typically higher in the invasive (33-37 degrees C) than in the indigenous (30-33 degrees C) species and the response to acclimation differs among the two groups.

It has also been predicted that current and future climate change will favour alien over indigenous species as a consequence of more favourable responses to warming in the former. It is therefore surprising that little is known about the environmental physiology of sub-Antarctic springtails and that few studies have explicitly tested the hypothesis that invasive species will outperform indigenous ones under warmer conditions. Here we present thermal tolerance data on three invasive (Pogonognathellus flavescens, Isotomurus cf. palustris, Ceratophysella denticulata) and two indigenous (Cryptopygus antarcticus, Tullbergia bisetosa) species of springtails from Marion Island, explicitly testing the idea that consistent differences exist between the indigenous and invasive species both in their absolute limits and the ways in which they respond to acclimation (at temperatures from 0 to 20 degrees C). Phenotypic plasticity is the first in a series of ways in which organisms might respond to altered environments. Using a poorly explored, but highly appropriate technique, we demonstrate that in these species the crystallization temperature (T-c) is equal to the lower lethal temperature. We also show that cooling rate (I degrees C min(-1); 0.1 degrees C min(-1); 0.5 degrees C h(-1) from 5 to -1 degrees C followed by 0.1 degrees C min(-1)) has little effect on Tc. The indigenous species typically have low T(c)s (c. -20 to - 13 degrees C depending on the acclimation temperature), whilst those of the invasive species tend to be higher (c. - 12 to - 6 degrees C) at the lower acclimation temperatures. However, Ceratophysella denticulata is an exception with a low T-c (c. -20 to - 18 degrees C), and in P. flavescens acclimation to 20 degrees C results in a pronounced decline in T-c. In general, the invasive and alien species do not differ substantially in acclimation effects on T-c (with the exception of the strong response in P. flavescens). Upper lethal temperatures (ULT50) are typically higher in the invasive (33-37 degrees C) than in the indigenous (30-33 degrees C) species and the response to acclimation differs among the two groups. The indigenous species show either a weak response to acclimation or ULT50 declines with increasing acclimation temperature, whereas in the invasive species ULT50 increases with acclimation temperature. These findings support the hypothesis that many invasive species will be favoured by climate change (warming and drying) at Marion Island.

Despite fueling considerable interest in the theory of host-parasitoid interactions, biological control has few unifying principles and no theoretical basis for understanding the differential pattern of success against these two pest groups. Potential explanations considered here include competitive limitation of natural enemy establishment, the influence of antagonistic parasitoid interactions, generation time ratio, and gregarious parasitoid development. An analysis of the biological control record showed that on average six natural enemies have been introduced per pest for both pest groups, providing no evidence of a differential intensity of competition. Similarly, use of a discrete time host-parasitoid model showed that antagonistic interactions that are common among parasitoids of Lepidoptera should not limit the success of biological control as such interactions can readily be counteracted by host refuge breaking. A similar model showed that a small generation time ratio (coupled with a broad window of host attack) and gregarious development can facilitate the suppression of pest abundance by parasitoids, and both were found to be positively associated with success in the biological control record. Of the four explanations considered here, generation time ratio coupled with a broad window of host attack appears to provide the best explanation for the differential pattern of success."

We examined this question in a clonal population of invasive freshwater snails (Potamopyrgus antipodarum) from the western United States by testing whether observed plasticity in life history traits conferred higher fitness across a range of temperatures. We raised isofemale lines from three populations from different climate regimes (high- and low-elevation rivers and an estuary) in a split-brood, common-garden design in three temperatures. We measured life history and growth traits and calculated population growth rate (as a measure of fitness) using an age-structured projection matrix model. We found a strong effect of temperature on all traits, but no evidence for divergence in the average level of traits among populations. Levels of genetic variation and significant reaction norm divergence for life history traits suggested some role for adaptation. Plasticity varied among traits and was lowest for size and reproductive traits compared to age-related traits and fitness. Plasticity in fitness was intermediate, suggesting that invasive populations are not general-purpose genotypes with respect to the range of temperatures studied. Thus, by considering plasticity in fitness and its component traits, we have shown that trait plasticity alone does not yield the same fitness across a relevant set of temperature conditions."

If a species is to become common in a community, incoming propagules must first be able to establish. The latter could be determined by competition with resident plants, the impacts of herbivores and soil biota, or a combination of these factors. We aimed to tease apart the roles that these factors play in determining establishment success in grassland communities of 10 alien and 10 native plant species that are either common or rare in Germany, and from four families. In a two-year multisite field experiment, we assessed the establishment success of seeds and seedlings separately, under all factorial combinations of low vs. high disturbance (mowing vs mowing and tilling of the upper soil layer), suppression or not of pathogens (biocide application) and, for seedlings only, reduction or not of herbivores (net-cages). Native species showed greater establishment success than alien species across all treatments, regardless of their commonness. Moreover, establishment success of all species was positively affected by disturbance. Aliens showed lower establishment success in undisturbed sites with biocide application. Release of the undisturbed resident community from pathogens by biocide application might explain this lower establishment success of aliens. These findings were consistent for establishment from either seeds or seedlings, although less significantly so for seedlings, suggesting a more important role of pathogens in very early stages of establishment after germination. Herbivore exclusion did play a limited role in seedling establishment success.Synthesis: In conclusion, we found that less disturbed grassland communities exhibited strong biotic resistance to establishment success of species, whether alien or native. However, we also found evidence that alien species may benefit weakly from soilborne enemy release, but that this advantage over native species is lost when the latter are also released by biocide application. Thus, disturbance was the major driver for plant species establishment success and effects of pathogens on alien plant establishment may only play a minor role."

This study presents a comprehensive overview of all alien aquatic plants in Europe, their places of origin and their distribution within the 46 European countries. In total, 96 aquatic species from 30 families have been reported as aliens from at least one European country. Most alien aquatic plants are native to Northern America, followed by Asia and Southern America. Elodea canadensis is the most widespread alien aquatic plant in Europe, reported from 41 European countries. Azolla filiculoides ranks second (25), followed by Vallisneria spiralis (22) and Elodea nuttallii (20). The highest number of alien aquatic plant species has been found in Italy and France (34 species), followed by Germany (27), Belgium and Hungary (both 26) and the Netherlands (24). Even though the number of alien aquatic plants seems relatively small, the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization (EPPO, ) has listed 18 of these species as invasive or potentially invasive within the EPPO region. As ornamental trade has been regarded as the major pathway for the introduction of alien aquatic plants, trading bans seem to be the most effective option to reduce the risk of further unintended entry of alien aquatic plants into Europe."

As a result, it is difficult to make predictions about which species are likely to become successful invaders or which environments are likely to be most susceptible to invasion. To address these issues, we developed a data set on fish invasions in watersheds throughout California (USA) that includes failed introductions. Our data set includes information from three stages of the invasion process (establishment, spread, and integration). We define seven categorical predictor variables (trophic status, size of native range, parental care, maximum adult size, physiological tolerance, distance from nearest native source, and propagule pressure) and one continuous predictor variable (prior invasion success) for all introduced species. Using an information-theoretic approach we evaluate 45 separate hypotheses derived from the invasion literature over these three stages of the invasion process. Our results indicate that successful establishment is best predicted with our global model that includes all seven variables, suggesting an inherent multivariate nature to the establishment stage of the invasion process. Spread of introduced fishes is best predicted using measures of physiological tolerance and propagule pressure. Species integration and impact is best predicted using a measure of prior invasion success. The results from analyses like this will help guide and inform management decisions regarding current and future species introductions."

Parallel transects, placed at varying distances from the adjacent road or trail were used to determine alien species richness and frequency at individual study sites. Fifteen alien species were recorded, two Eurasian grasses, Phleum pratense and Poa pratensis, being particularly common in most of the study sites. In sites adjacent to primary and secondary roads, alien species richness declined out to the most distant transect, suggesting that alien species are successfully invading grasslands from the roadside areas. In study sites adjacent to backcountry trails, absence of a comparable decline and unexpectedly high levels of alien species richness 100 m from the trailside suggest that alien species have been introduced in off-trail areas. The results of this study imply that in spite of low levels of livestock grazing and other anthropogenic disturbances, fescue grasslands in nature reserves of this region are vulnerable to invasion by lien flora Given the prominent role that roadsides play in the establishment and dispersal of alien flora, road construction should be viewed from a biological, rather than an engineering. perspective- Nature reserve man agers should establish effective roadside vegetation management programs that include monitoring quickly treating keystone alien species upon their initial occurrence in nature reserves, and creating buffer zones on roadsides leading to nature reserves."

The plant section of the DAISIE database is based on national checklists from 48 European countries/regions and Israel; for many of them the data were compiled during the project and for some countries DAISIE collected the first comprehensive checklists of alien species, based on primary data (e.g., Cyprus, Greece, R Y. R. O. Macedonia, Slovenia, Ukraine). In total, the database contains records of 5789 alien plant species in Europe (including those native to a part of Europe but alien to another part), of which 2843 are alien to Europe (of extra-European origin). The research focus was on naturalized species; there are in total 3749 naturalized aliens in Europe, of which 1780 are alien to Europe. This represents a marked increase compared to 1568 alien species reported by a previous analysis of data in Flora Europaea (1964-1980). Casual aliens were marginally considered and are represented by 1507 species with European origins and 872 species whose native range falls outside Europe. The highest diversity of alien species is concentrated in industrialized countries with a tradition of good botanical recording or intensive recent research. The highest number of all alien species, regardless of status, is reported from Belgium (1969), the United Kingdom (1779) and Czech Republic (1378). The United Kingdom (857), Germany (450), Belgium (447) and Italy (440) are countries with the most naturalized neophytes. The number of naturalized neophytes in European countries is determined mainly by the interaction of temperature and precipitation; it increases with increasing precipitation but only in climatically warm and moderately warm regions. Of the nowadays naturalized neophytes alien to Europe, 50% arrived after 1899, 25% after 1962 and 10% after 1989. At present, approximately 6.2 new species, that are capable of naturalization, are arriving each year. Most alien species have relatively restricted European distributions; half of all naturalized species occur in four or fewer countries/regions, whereas 70% of non-naturalized species occur in only one region. Alien species are drawn from 213 families, dominated by large global plant families which have a weedy tendency and have undergone major radiations in temperate regions (Asteraceae, Poaceae, Rosaceae, Fabaceae, Brassicaceae). There are 1567 genera, which have alien members in European countries, the commonest being globally-diverse genera comprising mainly urban and agricultural weeds (e.g., Amaranthus, Chenopodium and Solanum) or cultivated for ornamental purposes (Cotoneaster, the genus richest in alien species). Only a few large genera which have successfully invaded (e.g., Oenothera, Oxalis, Panicum, Helianthus) are predominantly of non-European origin. Conyza canadensis, Helianthus tuberosus and Robinia pseudoacacia are most widely distributed alien species. Of all naturalized aliens present in Europe, 64.1% occur in industrial habitats and 58.5% on arable land and in parks and gardens. Grasslands and woodlands are also highly invaded, with 37.4 and 31.5%, respectively, of all naturalized aliens in Europe present in these habitats. Mires, bogs and fens are least invaded; only approximately 10% of aliens in Euope occur there. Intentional introductions to Europe (62.8% of the total number of naturalized aliens) prevail over unintentional (37.2%). Ornamental and horticultural introductions escaped from cultivation account for the highest number of species, 52.2% of the total. Among unintentional introductions, contaminants of seed, mineral materials and other commodities are responsible for 1091 alien species introductions to Europe (76.6% of all species introduced unintentionally) and 363 species are assumed to have arrived as stowaways (directly associated with human transport but arriving independently of commodity). Most aliens in Europe have a native range in the same continent (28.6% of all donor region records are from another part of Europe where the plant is native); in terms of species numbers the contribution of Europe as a region of origin is 53.2%. Considering aliens to Europe separately, 45.8% of species have their native distribution in North and South America, 45.9% in Asia, 20.7% in Africa and 5.3% in Australasia. Based on species composition, European alien flora can be classified into five major groups: (1) north-western, comprising Scandinavia and the UK; (2) west-central, extending from Belgium and the Netherlands to Germany and Switzerland; (3) Baltic, including only the former Soviet Baltic states; (4) east-central, comprizing the remainder of central and eastern Europe; (5) southern, covering the entire Mediterranean region. The clustering patterns cut across some European bioclimatic zones; cultural factors such as regional trade links and traditional local preferences for crop, forestry and ornamental species are also important by influencing the introduced species pool. Finally, the paper evaluates a state of the art in the field of plant invasions in Europe, points to research gaps and outlines avenues of further research towards documenting alien plant invasions in Europe. The data are of varying quality and need to be further assessed with respect to the invasion status and residence time of the species included. This concerns especially the naturalized/casual status; so far, this information is available comprehensively for only 19 countries/regions of the 49 considered. Collating an integrated database on the alien flora of Europe can form a principal contribution to developing a European-wide management strategy of alien species."

There are 1567 genera, which have alien members in European countries, the commonest being globally-diverse genera comprising mainly urban and agricultural weeds (e.g., Amaranthus, Chenopodium and Solanum) or cultivated for ornamental purposes (Cotoneaster, the genus richest in alien species). Only a few large genera which have successfully invaded (e.g., Oenothera, Oxalis, Panicum, Helianthus) are predominantly of non-European origin. Conyza canadensis, Helianthus tuberosus and Robinia pseudoacacia are most widely distributed alien species. Of all naturalized aliens present in Europe, 64.1% occur in industrial habitats and 58.5% on arable land and in parks and gardens. Grasslands and woodlands are also highly invaded, with 37.4 and 31.5%, respectively, of all naturalized aliens in Europe present in these habitats. Mires, bogs and fens are least invaded; only approximately 10% of aliens in Euope occur there. Intentional introductions to Europe (62.8% of the total number of naturalized aliens) prevail over unintentional (37.2%). Ornamental and horticultural introductions escaped from cultivation account for the highest number of species, 52.2% of the total. Among unintentional introductions, contaminants of seed, mineral materials and other commodities are responsible for 1091 alien species introductions to Europe (76.6% of all species introduced unintentionally) and 363 species are assumed to have arrived as stowaways (directly associated with human transport but arriving independently of commodity). Most aliens in Europe have a native range in the same continent (28.6% of all donor region records are from another part of Europe where the plant is native); in terms of species numbers the contribution of Europe as a region of origin is 53.2%. Considering aliens to Europe separately, 45.8% of species have their native distribution in North and South America, 45.9% in Asia, 20.7% in Africa and 5.3% in Australasia. Based on species composition, European alien flora can be classified into five major groups: (1) north-western, comprising Scandinavia and the UK; (2) west-central, extending from Belgium and the Netherlands to Germany and Switzerland; (3) Baltic, including only the former Soviet Baltic states; (4) east-central, comprizing the remainder of central and eastern Europe; (5) southern, covering the entire Mediterranean region. The clustering patterns cut across some European bioclimatic zones; cultural factors such as regional trade links and traditional local preferences for crop, forestry and ornamental species are also important by influencing the introduced species pool. Finally, the paper evaluates a state of the art in the field of plant invasions in Europe, points to research gaps and outlines avenues of further research towards documenting alien plant invasions in Europe. The data are of varying quality and need to be further assessed with respect to the invasion status and residence time of the species included. This concerns especially the naturalized/casual status; so far, this information is available comprehensively for only 19 countries/regions of the 49 considered. Collating an integrated database on the alien flora of Europe can form a principal contribution to developing a European-wide management strategy of alien species."

To date, their impact has largely been studied independently, and knowledge on whether climate warming will promote invasions relies strongly on bioclimatic models. We therefore set up a study to experimentally compare responses to warming in native and alien plant species. Ten congeneric species pairs were exposed to ambient and elevated temperature (+3A degrees C) in sunlit, climate-controlled chambers, under optimal water and nutrient supply to avoid interaction with other factors. All species pairs combined, total plant biomass reacted differently to warming in alien versus native species, which could be traced to significantly different root responses. On average, native species became less productive in the warmer climate, whereas their alien counterparts showed no response. The three alien species with the strongest warming response (Lathyrus latifolius, Cerastium tomentosum and Artemisia verlotiorum) are currently non-invasive but all originate from regions with a warmer climate. Still, other alien species that also originate from warmer regions became less or remained equally productive. Structural or ecophysiological acclimation to warming was largely absent, both in native and alien species, apart from light-saturated photosynthetic rate, where warming tended to restrain the native but not the alien species. A difference in the capacity to acclimate photosynthetic rates to the new climate may therefore have caused the contrasting biomass response. Future experiments are needed to ascertain whether climate warming can effectively tip the balance between native and alien competitors."

The effects of pollinator change on plant reproduction were surveyed on these contrasting island groups. The total visitation rates and the number of interacting visitor groups on main islands were 63% and 30% lower than that on satellite islands, respectively. On the main islands, the honeybees preferred to visit alien flowers, whereas the dominant endemic bees on satellite islands tended to visit native flowers more frequently than alien flowers. These results suggest that alien anoles destroy the endemic pollination system and caused shift to alien mutualism. On the main islands, the natural fruit set of alien plants was significantly higher than that of native plants. In addition, the natural fruit set was positively correlated with the visitation rate of honeybees. Pollen limitation was observed in 53.3% of endemic species but only 16.7% of alien species.

Alternanthera philoxeroides, endemic to South America, is an amphibious clonal weed invading worldwide. It tends to colonize disturbed habitats such as riparian zones, floodplain wetlands and agricultural areas. We developed an analytical model to explore the interactive effects of two types of physical disturbances, shoot mowing and root fragmentation, on biomass production dynamics of A. philoxeroides. The model is based on two major biological assumptions: (1) allometric growth of root (belowground) vs. shoot (aboveground) biomass and (2) exponential regrowth of shoot biomass after mowing. The model analysis revealed that the interaction among allometric growth pattern, shoot mowing frequency and root fragmentation intensity might lead to diverse plant 'fates'. For A. philoxeroides whose root allocation decreases with growing plant size, control by shoot mowing was faced with two dilemmas. (1) Shoot regrowth can be effectively suppressed by frequent mowing. However, frequent shoot mowing led to higher biomass allocation to thick storage roots, which enhanced the potential for faster future plant growth. (2) In the context of periodic shoot mowing, individual shoot biomass converged to a stable equilibrium value which was independent of the root fragmentation intensity. However, root fragmentation resulted in higher equilibrium population shoot biomass and higher frequency of shoot mowing required for effective control. In conclusion, the interaction between allometric growth and physical disturbances may partially account for the successful invasion of A. philoxeroides; improper mechanical control practices could function as disturbances and result in exacerbated invasion."

Main conclusions Stream-flow regimes are strong determinants of riparian vegetation structure, and hydrological alterations can drive dominance shifts to introduced species that have an adaptive suite of traits. Deep alluvial groundwater on intermittent rivers favours the deep-rooted, stress-adapted Tamarix over the shallower-rooted and more competitive Populus and Salix. On flow-regulated rivers, shifts in flood timing favour the reproductively opportunistic Tamarix over Populus and Salix, both of which have narrow germination windows. The prevailing hydrological conditions thus favour a new dominant pioneer species in the riparian corridors of the American Southwest. These results reaffirm the importance of reinstating stream-flow regimes (inclusive of groundwater flows) for re-establishing the native pioneer trees as the dominant forest type."

We studied the morphological traits of Impatiens glandulifera in the native (Indian Himalayas) and introduced (UK) range and evaluated what influences natural enemies and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) have on plant performance. We compared height, total leaf area, root: shoot ratio, natural enemy damage and the colonisation of AMF from individual plants within and between ranges twice in 2010 during the months of June and August. In addition, in August 2010, we estimated the number of reproductive units (expressed as the sum of flowers, seed capsule and seeds) at each site. We found that all morphological traits varied between populations and countries, though in general introduced populations, and the semi-natural population in India, showed higher performance compared to natural native populations. There was only an indication that natural enemy damage, which was significantly higher in the native range, negatively affected reproductive units. Within the introduced range, the percentage colonisation of AMF was negatively associated with plant performance indicating that I. glandulifera may associate with an incompatible AMF species incurring a cost to invasive populations. We conclude that species which are heavily regulated in the native range, though still show high levels of performance, should be considered undesirable introductions into similar ecoclimatic ranges due to the potential that these species will become highly invasive species."

Several disturbance treatments were applied; these included the creation of gaps of contrasting size and the mowing of the vegetation to different heights and at different times of the year. This paper analyzes the factors controlling the initial phase of the resulting invasions within the plots subject to gap creation. The susceptibility of the indigenous community to invasion was strongly related to the availability of bare ground created, but greatest success occurred where disturbance coincided with eutrophication. Disturbance damage to the indigenous dominants (particularly Festuca ovina) was an important determinant of seedling establishment by the sown invaders. Large seed size was identified as an important characteristic allowing certain species to establish relatively evenly across the productivity-disturbance matrix; smaller-seeded species were more dependent on disturbance for establishment. Successful and unsuccessful invaders were also distinguished to some extent by differences in germination requirements and present geographical distribution."

Location Tahiti and Moorea, French Polynesia. Methods Our study was conducted at six sites which vary in the abundance of M. calvescens. We used dietary data from three frugivores (two introduced, one endemic) to determine whether patterns of fruit consumption are related to invasive tree abundance. We constructed seed dispersal networks for each island to evaluate how patterns of interaction between frugivores and plants shift at highly invaded sites. Results Two frugivores increased consumption of M. calvescens fruit at highly invaded sites and decreased consumption of other dietary items. The endemic fruit dove, Ptilinopus purpuratus, consumed more native fruit than either of the two introduced frugivores (the red-vented bulbul, Pycnonotus cafer, and the silvereye, Zosterops lateralis), and introduced frugivores showed a low potential to act as dispersers of native plants. Network patterns on the highly invaded island of Tahiti were dominated by introduced plants and birds, which were responsible for the majority of plantfrugivore interactions. Main conclusions Shifts in the diet of introduced birds, coupled with reduced populations of endemic frugivores, caused differences in properties of the seed dispersal network on the island of Tahiti compared to the less invaded island of Moorea. These results demonstrate that the presence of invasive fruit-bearing plants and introduced frugivores can alter seed dispersal networks, and that the patterns of alteration depend both on the frugivore community and on the relative abundance of available fruit."

Methods The analysis includes a chronological table of introductions, a biogeographical analysis and an assessment of the likelihood of establishment according to species, propagule pressure, area of origin and characteristics of the recipient area. Results The main vector of such introductions was the intentional importation of live animals. Introductions increased in developed countries and proportionately to the volume of imported mammals. Moreover, areas characterized by higher numbers of native squirrels were more invaded. Squirrels were often introduced deliberately and only to a smaller extent escaped from captivity. The likelihood of their establishment increased proportionately to the number of animals released and decreased proportionately to the increase of the latitudinal distance between the recipient area and the native range of the species. The likelihood that the release of one pair of either Sciurus or Callosciurus species would establish a new population was higher than 50%. Main conclusion Squirrels proved to be successful invaders and their importation should be restricted so as to prevent further introductions."

The European hare (Lepus europaeus) and wild boar (Sus scrofa) are invasive species known to cause substantial environmental damage, and were introduced to Argentina during the early 1900s. We compared the relative importance of anthropogenic and environmental factors in hare and boar occurrence in Nahuel Huapi National Park, Argentina, and assessed the hypothesis that invasion can occur regardless of anthropogenic disturbance. Also, we assessed whether hare and boar occupancy offered support for the disturbance hypothesis, which states that invasive species are facilitated by anthropogenic disturbance. We deployed 80 cameras from February to May 2012 and January to April 2013 and at each site measured three environmental (land cover, horizontal cover, and percentage herbaceous vegetation) and three anthropogenic (distance to nearest human settlement, distance to nearest road, and average daily number of people) variables. We used likelihood-based occupancy modeling to estimate site occurrence and detectability. We obtained 480 independent detections of hares and 134 of boars in 1680 camera days. Environmental factors had a greater effect on hare occupancy than anthropogenic disturbances, and hare occupancy was greater in more open areas and closer to human settlements, supporting both hypotheses. Boar occurrence was equally influenced by anthropogenic and environmental factors, and offered mixed support for both hypotheses; boars were present only in humid land covers, and occupancy was lesser closer to settlements but greater closer to roads. Species responses to anthropogenic and environmental factors can vary based on life history traits and role in human society. Identifying the effect of environmental factors and human disturbances on species is fundamental for allocating limited resources in management and conservation.

Thus, intertidal and shallow marine habitats are largely being replaced by a variety of artificial substrata (e. g. breakwaters, seawalls, jetties). Understanding the ecological functioning of these artificial habitats is key to planning their design and management, in order to minimise their impacts and to improve their potential to contribute to marine biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Nonetheless, little effort has been made to assess the role of human disturbances in shaping the structure of assemblages on marine artificial infrastructures. We tested the hypothesis that some negative impacts associated with the expansion of opportunistic and invasive species on urban infrastructures can be related to the severe human disturbances that are typical of these environments, such as those from maintenance and renovation works. Methodology/Principal Findings: Maintenance caused a marked decrease in the cover of dominant space occupiers, such as mussels and oysters, and a significant enhancement of opportunistic and invasive forms, such as biofilm and macroalgae. These effects were particularly pronounced on sheltered substrata compared to exposed substrata. Experimental application of the disturbance in winter reduced the magnitude of the impacts compared to application in spring or summer. We use these results to identify possible management strategies to inform the improvement of the ecological value of artificial marine infrastructures. Conclusions/Significance: We demonstrate that some of the impacts of globally expanding marine urban infrastructures, such as those related to the spread of opportunistic, and invasive species could be mitigated through ecologically-driven planning and management of long-term maintenance of these structures. Impact mitigation is a possible outcome of policies that consider the ecological features of built infrastructures and the fundamental value of controlling biodiversity in marine urban systems."

Location Valparaiso Region, central Chile Methods We sampled seed rain, seedbank emergence and establishment of species in four paired burned and unburned areas and compared (using GLMM) fire resistance and propagule arrival of alien and native species. To assess the relative importance of seed dispersal and seedbank survival in explaining plant establishment after fire, we compared seed rain and seedbank structure with post-fire vegetation using ordination analyses. Results Fire did not change the proportion of alien species in the coastal matorral. However, fire increased the number of annual species (natives and aliens) of which 87% were aliens. Fire reduced the alien seedbank and not the native seedbank, but alien species remained dominant in burned soil samples (66% of the total species richness). Seed rain was higher for alien annuals than for native annuals or perennials, thus contributing to their establishment after fire. Nevertheless, seed rain was less important than seedbank survival in explaining plant establishment in burned areas. Main conclusions Anthropogenic fires favoured alien and native annuals. Thus, fire did not increase the alien/native ratio but increased the richness of alien species. The successful establishment of alien annuals was attributable to their ability to maintain rich seedbanks in burned areas and to the greater propagule arrival compared to native species. The native seedbank also survived fire, indicating that the herbaceous community has become highly resilient after centuries of human disturbances. Our results demonstrate that fire is a relevant factor for the maintenance of alien-dominated grasslands in the matorral and highlight the importance of considering the interactive effect of seed rain and seedbank survival to understand plant invasion patterns in fire-prone ecosystems."

The input of anthropogenic resources has increased on islands and particularly supplemented non-native consumers with extra resources. We test the hypothesis that the anthropogenic establishments of super-abundant gulls and invasive iceplants Carpobrotus spp. have both altered the dynamics of an introduced black rat Rattus rattus population. On Bagaud Island, two habitats have been substantially modified by the anthropogenic subsidies of gulls and iceplants, in contrast to the native Mediterranean scrubland with no anthropogenic inputs. Rats were trapped in all three habitats over two contrasting years of rainfall patterns to investigate: (1) the effect of anthropogenic subsidies on rat density, age-ratio and growth rates, and (2) the role of rainfall variability in modulating the effects of subsidies between years. We found that the growth rates of rats dwelling in the non-subsidized habitat varied with environmental fluctuation, whereas rats dwelling in the gull colony maintained high growth rates during both dry and rainy years. The presence of anthropogenic subsidies apparently mitigated environmental stress. Age ratio and rat density varied significantly and predictably among years, seasons, and habitats. While rat densities always peaked higher in the gull colony, especially after rat breeding in spring, higher captures of immature rats were recorded during the second year in all habitats, associated with higher rainfall. The potential for non-native rats to benefit from anthropogenic resources has important implications for the management of similar species on islands."

The pattern at small scales has been interpreted as evidence that native plants can competitively exclude invasive species. Large-scale patterns have been understood to result from environmental heterogeneity, among other causes. We investigated species richness patterns among submerged and floating-leaved aquatic plants (87 native species and eight invasives) in 103 temperate lakes in Connecticut (northeastern USA) and found neither a consistently negative relationship at small (3-m(2)) scales, nor a positive relationship at large scales. Native species richness at sampling locations was uncorrelated with invasive species richness in 37 of the 60 lakes where invasive plants occurred; richness was negatively correlated in 16 lakes and positively correlated in seven. No correlation between native and invasive species richness was found at larger spatial scales (whole lakes and counties). Increases in richness with area were uncorrelated with abiotic heterogeneity. Logistic regression showed that the probability of occurrence of five invasive species increased in sampling locations (3 m(2), n = 2980 samples) where native plants occurred, indicating that native plant species richness provided no resistance against invasion. However, the probability of three invasive species' occurrence declined as native plant density increased, indicating that density, if not species richness, provided some resistance with these species. Density had no effect on occurrence of three other invasive species. Based on these results, native species may resist invasion at small spatial scales only in communities where density is high (i.e., in communities where competition among individuals contributes to community structure). Most hydrophyte communities, however, appear to be maintained in a nonequilibrial condition by stress and/or disturbance. Therefore, most aquatic plant communities in temperate lakes are likely to be vulnerable to invasion."

One largely anecdotal observation is that polluted or degraded areas will accumulate more invaders than less-impacted sites. However, the role of abiotic factors alone in influencing invisibility has been difficult to isolate, often because the supply of potential invaders is confounded with conditions thought to increase vulnerability to invasion. Here, we conducted a field experiment to test how the assemblages of exotic versus native marine invertebrates changed during community assembly under different exposure levels of a common pollutant, copper. The experiment was conducted by deploying fouling panels in a Randomized Block Design in San Francisco Bay. Panels were periodically removed, placed into buckets with differing copper concentrations, and returned to the field after 3 days. This design allowed propagule availability to the plates to be statistically independent of short-term copper exposure. The results demonstrate that copper caused significant differences in community structure. Average native species richness was significantly affected by copper exposure, but average exotic richness was not. The total native species pool within treatments exhibited a greater than 40% decline within increasing copper, while the exotic species pool did not change significantly. These results confirm that anthropogenic alteration of abiotic factors influences invader success, indicating that management strategies to reduce invader impacts should include both efforts to improve environmental conditions as well as reduce invader supply."

In Araucaria Forest, more than a thousand Pinus seeds landed annually in a hectare; however, experimentally exposed seeds were 100% removed in only 6 days. Furthermore, all experimentally transplanted seedlings of Pinus taeda and Eucalyptus saligna died in less than a year in Araucaria Forest, but not in the monocultures. Correlative evidence suggests that this mortality was associated to plant community richness, plant abundance, and soil fertility. Araucaria angustifolia, in contrast, showed an establishment success in ecologically-managed tree monocultures as high as that exhibited in its natural habitat. The current resistance of Araucaria Forest to invasion by exotic timber trees is good news for the conservation of Araucaria Forest remnants and for its keystone species.

We performed an architectural analysis to gain an understanding of the structural and ontogenic properties of common buckthorn (Rhamnus cathartica L., Rhamnaceae) growing in the understory and under an open canopy. We found that ontogenic effects on growth need to be calibrated if a full description of phenotypic plasticity is to be obtained. Our analysis pointed to three levels of organization (or nested structural units) in R. cathartica. Their modulation in relation to light conditions leads to the expression of two architectural strategies that involve sets of traits known to confer competitive advantage in their respective environments. In the understory, the plant develops a tree-like form. Its strategy here is based on restricting investment in exploitation structures while promoting major vertical exploration and is probably key to species survival in the understory. Under an open canopy, the second strategy leads the plant to adopt a shrub-like shape. It develops densely branched exploitation structures and flowers abundantly and rapidly. This strategy perfectly matches its aggressive behaviour observed in full sunlight. We propose, as hypotheses, that these two light-related strategies are implicated in the ability of R. cathartica to outcompete the surrounding vegetation in a range of environmental conditions."

We constructed competitive hierarchies for a representative suite of species from coastal dune communities that have been invaded by the Asteraceae shrub, bitou (Chrysanthemoides monilifera subsp. rotundata). We used a comparative phytometer approach, where the invader species was grown with or without a suite of native species in glasshouse trials. This was used to construct competition hierarchies under two water stress conditions: non-droughted and droughted. The treatments were designed to simulate current and potential future water availability respectively. We found that the invader experienced fewer competitive effects from some native species under water stress, particularly with regard to below-ground biomass effects. Native species were often poor competitors with the invader, despite their adaptation to periodic water stress in native coastal environments. Of the native species with significant competitive effects on the invader, functionally similar shrub species were the most effective competitors, as expressed in below-ground biomass. The relative position of species in the hierarchy was consistent across water treatments based on below-ground bitou biomass, but was contingent on water treatment when based on above-ground bitou biomass. The competitive effects of native species on an invader are affected by water stress. While the direction of response to water stress is species-specific, many species have small competitive effects on the invader under droughted conditions. This could allow an increase in invader dominance with climate change."

Based on the premise that an invader's vulnerability to predation is influenced by its evolutionary experience with the predator and its ability to compete for refugia, we hypothesized that amphipod species replacement is facilitated through selective predation by the round goby Neogobius melanostomus, a Ponto-Caspian fish that invaded the Great Lakes in the early 1990s and is now colonizing the St. Lawrence River. In laboratory experiments, we determined if E. ischnus excludes G. fasciatus from mussel patches, and if the vulnerability of G. fasciatus to predation by gobies is increased in the presence of the invasive amphipod. E. ischnus and G. fasciatus did not differ in their use of mussel patches, either when alone or in each other's presence. Both species were equally vulnerable to predation by the round goby. In field experiments, we determined if the round goby exerts a stronger impact than native predators on the relative abundance of amphipod species. Our results suggest that E. ischnus is more vulnerable to native predators, but the round goby does not have a differential impact on the native amphipod. We conclude that competition with E. ischnus does not increase the vulnerability of G. fasciatus to goby predation, and that the round goby does not promote the replacement of G. fasciatus by E. ischnus in the St. Lawrence River. The outcome of antagonistic interactions between exotic and native amphipods is mediated more by abiotic factors than by shared evolutionary history with other co-occurring exotic species."

The relative likelihood of seed predation and dispersal by the black rat, which is the most common rat in Hawaiian forest, was tested with field and laboratory experiments. In the field, fruits of eight native and four non-native common woody plant species were arranged individually on the forest floor in four treatments that excluded vertebrates of different sizes. Eleven species had a portion (3-100%) of their fruits removed from vertebrate-accessible treatments, and automated cameras photographed only black rats removing fruit. In the laboratory, black rats were offered fruits of all 12 species to assess consumption and seed fate. Seeds of two species (non-native Clidemia hirta and native Kadua affinis) passed intact through the digestive tracts of rats. Most of the remaining larger-seeded species had their seeds chewed and destroyed, but for several of these, some partly damaged or undamaged seeds survived rat exposure. The combined field and laboratory findings indicate that many interactions between black rats and seeds of native and non-native plants may result in dispersal. Rats are likely to be affecting plant communities through both seed predation and dispersal. KeywordsBlack rat-Captive feeding trials-Frugivory-Islands-Rodent-Seed size"

The ""driver"" model predicts that invaded communities are highly interactive, with subordinate native species being limited or excluded by competition from the exotic dominants. The ""passenger"" model predicts that invaded communities are primarily structured by noninteractive factors (environmental change, dispersal limitation) that are less constraining on the exotics, which thus dominate. We tested these alternative hypotheses in an invaded, fragmented, and fire-suppressed oak savanna. We examined the impact of two invasive dominant perennial grasses on community structure using a reduction (mowing of aboveground biomass) and removal (weeding of above- and belowground biomass) experiment conducted at different seasons and soil depths. We examined the relative importance of competition vs. dispersal limitation with experimental seed additions. Competition by the dominants limits the abundance and reproduction of many native and exotic species based on their increased performance with removals and mowing. The treatments resulted in increased light availability and bare soil; soil moisture and N were unaffected. Although competition was limiting for some, 36 of 79 species did not respond to the treatments or declined in the absence of grass cover. Seed additions revealed that some subordinates are dispersal limited; competition alone was insufficient to explain their rarity even though it does exacerbate dispersal inefficiencies by lowering reproduction. While the net effects of the dominants were negative, their presence restricted woody plants, facilitated seedling survival with moderate disturbance (i.e., treatments applied in the fall), or was not the primary limiting factor for the occurrence of some species. Finally, the species most functionally distinct from the dominants (forbs, woody plants) responded most significantly to the treatments. This suggests that relative abundance is determined more by trade-offs relating to environmental conditions (long-term fire suppression) than to traits relating to resource capture (which should most impact functionally similar species). This points toward the passenger model as the underlying cause of exotic dominance, although their combined effects (suppressive and facilitative) on community structure are substantial."

These islands were connected to the continent more than 5.35 million years ago and are now located <200 km from the coast. Methods: We compiled a database of almost 3000 phytosociological releves from the Balearic Islands and Catalonia and compared the level of invasion by alien plants in island versus mainland communities. Twenty distinct plant community types were compared between island and mainland counterparts. Results: The percentage of plots with alien species, number, percentage and cover percentage of alien species per plot was greater in Catalonia than in the Balearic Islands in most communities. Overall, across communities, more alien species were found in the mainland (53) compared to the islands (only nine). Despite these differences, patterns of the level of invasion in communities were highly consistent between the islands and mainland. The most invaded communities were ruderal and riparian. Main conclusion: Our results indicate that para-oceanic island communities such as the Balearic Islands are less invaded than their mainland counterparts. This difference reflects a smaller regional alien species pool in the Balearic Islands than in the adjacent mainland, probably due to differences in landscape heterogeneity and propagule pressure."

Oxalis pes-caprae is a South African annual geophyte that reproduces via bulbils, and has spread in many Mediterranean and temperate regions of the world where introduced. Our study is one of the first detailed regional analyses of the occurrence and local abundance of a non-native plant.Methods  We conducted an extensive survey (2000 sampling points) to examine local and coarse-scale patterns in both the occurrence and abundance of O. pes-caprae on islands and in neighbouring mainland regions of Spain.Location  We analysed occurrence (number of samples where present) and abundance (percentage cover) on two Balearic Islands (Menorca and Mallorca) and in two mainland administrative provinces of Spain (Murcia and Valencia).Results Oxalis pes-caprae occurrence was consistently higher on islands. Occurrence varied among habitats, being the highest in tree groves and the lowest in forests and shrublands. It was never found in these two habitats on the mainland. Mean O. pes-caprae abundance was greatest in tree groves on the mainland, and in field margins and old fields on the islands. However, in general there were not significant differences in local abundances between island and mainland locations.Main conclusions  These findings suggest that local processes (such as the biotic resistance of plant communities) are less important than coarse-scale phenomena (such as environmental driving forces) in explaining differences in the invasion patterns observed between islands and adjacent mainland regions. We suggest that O. pes-caprae has occupied a larger proportion of available habitats on islands due to: (1) its strong dependence on domestic animal and human-mediated dispersal which are probably greater on the islands than in mainland areas, and (2) the smaller area encompassed by islands that, over a comparable period of time, enables a greater proportion of available habitats to be colonized (and hence higher occurrence) than equivalent larger mainland areas."

Environmental filtering is thought to result in the formation of groups of species with similar traits that tend to co-occur more often than expected by chance alone, known as Beta guilds. At a smaller scale, within a single Beta guild, species may be partitioned into Alpha guilds - groups of species that have similar resource use and hence should tend not to co-occur at small scales due the principle of limiting similarity. 2 This research investigates the effects of successional age and the presence of an invasive exotic species on Alpha and Beta guild structuring within plant communities along two successional river terrace sequences in the Waimakariri braided river system in New Zealand. 3 Fifteen sites were sampled, six with and nine without the Russel lupin (Lupinus polyphyllus), an invasive exotic species. At each site, species presence/absence was recorded in 100 circular quadrats (5 cm in diameter) at 30-cm intervals along a 30-m transect. Guild proportionality (Alpha guild structuring) was tested for using two a priori guild classifications each containing three guilds, and cluster analysis was used to test for environmental structuring between sites. 4 Significant assembly rules based on Alpha guild structuring were found, particularly for the monocot and dicot guild. Guild proportionality increased with increasing ecological age, which indicated an increase in the relative importance of competitive structuring at later stages of succession. This provides empirical support for Weiher and Keddy's theoretical model of community assembly. 5 Lupins were associated with altered Alpha and Beta guild structuring at early mid successional sites. Lupin-containing sites had higher silt content than sites without lupins, and this could have altered the strength and scale of competitive structuring within the communities present. 6 This research adds to the increasing evidence for the existence of assembly rules based on limiting similarity within plant communities, and demonstrates the need to incorporate gradients of environmental and competitive adversity when investigating the rules that govern community assembly."

Margarita Island (Venezuela) is a tropical Caribbean island that has undergone an accelerated urban development in the last 40 years. Because the island also has a high bird diversity with several endemic and threatened species, we evaluated the effect of urban development on bird species richness, assemblage structure, seasonal changes and feeding guilds. We defined an urban gradient from areas with high vegetation cover (remnant woodlands) through areas with intermediate vegetation (traditional towns) to areas with next to no vegetation (recent suburbs). Each experimental unit was replicated 3 times and birds were surveyed during the dry and rainy seasons. Richness decreased as urbanization increased, being severely depleted in the recent suburbs. The bird assemblage consisted of native species, including six endemic sub-species, but only one exotic, Columba livia. There were no seasonal changes in assemblage structure. We identified the species most tolerant and most sensitive to urbanization. Omnivorous birds were common along the gradient and granivores were also tolerant to urban development. Specialized insectivores and frugivores were the most negatively affected groups. The considerable amount of native woodland and other vegetation present in the traditional towns we evaluated, and their proximity to natural protected areas, favors the persistence of native bird species in these urban areas on Margarita Island."

Nevertheless, the relative importance of these factors will vary depending on the invaded habitat and the characteristics of the invasive species. Due to their harsh environmental conditions and remoteness, high-alpine habitats are often considered to be at low risk of plant invasion. However, an increasing number of reports have shown the presence and spread of non-native plant species in alpine habitats; thus, it is important to study which factors control the invasion process in these harsh habitats. In this study, we assessed the role of disturbance, soil characteristics, biotic resistance and seed rain in the establishment and abundance of the non-native invasive species Taraxacum officinale (dandelion) in the Andes of central Chile. By focusing on human-disturbed patches, naturally disturbed patches, and undisturbed patches, we did not find that disturbance per se, or its origin, affected the establishment and abundance of T. officinale. The abundance of this non-native invasive species was not negatively related to the diversity of native species at local scales, indicating no biotic resistance to invasion; instead, some positive relationships were found. Our results indicate that propagule pressure (assessed by the seed rain) and the abiotic soil characteristics are the main factors related to the abundance of this non-native invasive species. Hence, in contrast to what has been found for more benign habitats, disturbance and biotic resistance have little influence on the invasibility of T. officinale in this high-alpine habitat."

A potentially innovative, yet controversial, landscape-based long-term restoration approach is to replace missing plant-herbivore interactions with non-native herbivores. Aldabran giant (Aldabrachelys gigantea) and Madagascan radiated (Astrochelys radiata) tortoises, taxonomically and functionally similar to the extinct Mauritian giant tortoises (Cylindraspis spp.), were introduced to Round Island, Mauritius, in 2007 to control the non-native plants that were threatening persistence of native species. We monitored the response of the plant community to tortoise grazing for 11 months in enclosures before the tortoises were released and, compared the cost of using tortoises as weeders with the cost of using manual labor. At the end of this period, plant biomass; vegetation height and cover; and adult, seedling, flower, and seed abundance were 3-136 times greater in adjacent control plots than in the tortoise enclosures. After their release, the free-roaming tortoises grazed on most non-native plants and significantly reduced vegetation cover, height, and seed production, reflecting findings from the enclosure study. The tortoises generally did not eat native species, although they consumed those native species that increased in abundance following the eradication of mammalian herbivores. Our results suggest that introduced non-native tortoises are a more cost-effective approach to control non-native vegetation than manual weeding. Numerous long-term outcomes (e.g., change in species composition and soil seed bank) are possible following tortoise releases. Monitoring and adaptive management are needed to ensure that the replacement herbivores promote the recovery of native plants."

We used a dataset obtained at fine (0.25 m(2)) and coarse (ca. 1,000 m(2)) scales. The presence/absence of all species was recorded at both scales, and their biomass was also measured at the fine scale. We tested the association between tropical signalgrass biomass and individual native species with logistic regressions at the fine scale, and using the T-score index between tropical signalgrass and each native species at both scales. The likelihood of the occurrence of six species (submersed and free-floating) was negatively affected by tropical signalgrass biomass at the fine scale. T-scores showed that three species were less associated with tropical signalgrass than expected by chance, but 22 species co-occurred more than expected by chance at the coarse scale. Associations between species of Poaceae and tropical signalgrass were null at the fine scale, but were positive or null at the coarse scale. In addition to showing that spatial scale affects the patterns of association among the non-native and individual native species, our results indicate that phylogeny did not explain associations between the invasive and native macrophytes, at both scales."

Isolated oceanic islands provide an excellent model system for comparing the associations between herbivore species and plant species of different residency histories, namely endemic, indigenous (non-endemic) or introduced (naturalized or cultivated) species. My aim was to test the prediction that, on isolated oceanic islands, introduced plant species have a lower tendency to have an association with insect herbivores than do endemic and indigenous plant species. Location Ogasawara (Bonin) Islands in the western Pacific Ocean. Methods I examined the presence/absence of leaf-mining and leaf-galling insect species on 71 endemic, 31 indigenous, 18 naturalized and 31 cultivated (introduced but not naturalized) species of woody plants from 2004 to 2008. Results Leaf-mining insect species were found on 53.5%, 35.5%, 11.1% and 16.1% and leaf-galling species were found on 14.1%, 9.7%, 5.6% and 0% of endemic, indigenous, naturalized and cultivated plant species, respectively. Species of Lepidoptera (moths) and Hemiptera (primarily psyllids) comprised the dominant types of leaf miners and leaf gallers, respectively. Main conclusions The incidence of leaf miners and leaf gallers differed as a function of residency history of the plant species. Introduced (naturalized and cultivated) species were less frequently associated with leaf miners and leaf gallers than were native (endemic and indigenous) species, indicating that the leaf-mining and leaf-galling insect species, most of which feed on leaves of a particular native plant genus (i.e. they show oligophagy), have not yet begun to utilize most introduced plant species."

How closely related invasive species are to species in the native recipient community may drive patterns of herbivore and pathogen damage and therefore, may be important in understanding the success of some invasions. We compared herbivore and pathogen damage across a group of invasive species occurring in natural environments on the east coast of Australia. We examined whether the level of damage experienced by the invasive species was associated with the degree of phylogenetic relatedness between these plants and the native plants within the region. We found that phylogenetic distance to the nearest native relative was a good predictor of herbivore and pathogen damage on the invasive plants, explaining nearly 37 % of the variance in leaf damage. Total leaf damage and the variety of damage types declined with increasing phylogenetic distance to the nearest native relative. In addition, as the phylogenetic distance to the nearest native relative increased, invasive species were colonized by fewer functional guilds and the herbivore assemblage was increasingly dominated by generalist species. These results suggest that invasive species that are only distantly related to those in the native invaded community may be released from specialist natural enemies. Our results indicate that the phylogenetic relatedness of invasive plants to species in native communities is a significant predictor of the rate of colonization by the herbivore and pathogen community, and thus a useful tool to assess invasion potential."

We found that four native and one exotic bird species dispersed viable L. maackii seeds. Gut passage through American robins did not inhibit germination, but gut passage through cedar waxwings did. American robins moved mostly along woodlot edges and fencerows, leading us to project that most viable seeds would be defecated in such habitats, which are very suitable for L. maackii.

We found significant differences between the three woody legumes in the number of nodules produced, final plant biomass and shoot N-15 content. The number of nodules produced by A. longifolia was more than five times higher than the number of nodules produced by the native legumes. The obtained N-15 values suggest that both A. longifolia and U. europaeus incorporated more biologically-fixed nitrogen than C. grandiflorus which is also the species with the smallest distribution. Finally, differences were also found between the three species in the allocation of biomass in the different studied soils. Acacia longifolia displayed a lower phenotypic plasticity than the two native legumes which resulted in a greater allocation to aboveground biomass in the soils with lower nutrient content.

Contrary to experimental studies, when richness was important in explaining invasion probability, it was typically positively associated with species invasion. Invasion of several species had a unimodal response to resident species richness, which appeared to be a mixture of compositional influences and a richness effect.

Here, we test two hypotheses: exotic spider species dominate the community after burning; and two traits are prevalent for their colonisation ability: ballooning and body size, the latter being correlated with their dispersal ability. We established spring burn, summer burn and unburned experimental plots in a New Zealand tussock grassland area and collected annual samples 3 and 4 years before and after the burning, respectively. Exotic spider abundance increased in the two burn treatments, driven by an increase in Linyphiidae. Indicator analysis showed that exotic and native species characterised burned and unburned plots, respectively. Generalised linear mixed-effects models indicated that ballooning had a positive effect on the post-burning establishment (density) of spiders in summer burn plots but not in spring plots. Body size had a positive effect on colonisation and establishment. The ability to balloon may partly explain the dominance of exotic Linyphiidae species. Larger spiders are better at moving into and colonising burned sites probably because of their ability to travel longer distances over land. Native species showed a low resilience to burning, and although confirmation requires longer-term data, our findings suggest that frequent fires could cause long lasting damage to the native spider fauna of tussock grasslands, and we propose limiting the use of fire to essential situations."

I found that high functional diversity reduced the success of Centaurea by reducing resource availability. An equally important, but unstudied, question is whether diversity can buffer a community against the impacts of invasive species. In this experiment, although species diversity (independent of functional diversity) did not affect the success of the invader, the invader suppressed growth of species-poor communities more strongly. Invasion of Centaurea also increased summer evapotranspiration in species-poor communities. These results suggest that loss of species diversity alone does not affect community invasibility, but that communities with fewer species may be more likely to decline as a consequence of invasion."

Yet accurate predictions of community susceptibility to invasion remain elusive. The diversity resistance hypothesis, which argues that diverse communities are highly competitive and readily resist invasion(3-5), is supported by both theory(6) and experimental studies(7-14) conducted at small spatial scales. However, there is also convincing evidence that the relationship between the diversity of native and invading species is positive when measured at regional scales(3,11,15,16). Although this latter relationship may arise from extrinsic factors, such as resource heterogeneity, that covary with diversity of native and invading species at large scales, the mechanisms conferring greater invasion resistance to diverse communities at local scales remain unknown. Using neighbourhood analyses, a technique from plant competition studies(17-19), we show here that species diversity in small experimental grassland plots enhances invasion resistance by increasing crowding and species richness in localized plant neighbourhoods.

The ecological impacts of planted woodlands may include changes to the communities of understory plants and animals found among these nonnative trees relative to native woodlands, as well as invasion of adjacent habitat areas through spread beyond the originally planted areas. Eucalypts (Eucalyptus spp.) are among the most widely planted trees worldwide, and are very common in California, USA. The goals of our investigation were to compare the biological communities of nonnative eucalypt woodlands to native oak woodlands in coastal central California, and to examine whether planted eucalypt groves have increased in size over the past decades. We assessed site and habitat attributes and characterized biological communities using understory plant, ground-dwelling arthropod, amphibian, and bird communities as indicators. Degree of difference between native and nonnative woodlands depended on the indicator used. Eucalypts had significantly greater canopy height and cover, and significantly lower cover by perennial plants and species richness of arthropods than oaks. Community composition of arthropods also differed significantly between eucalypts and oaks. Eucalypts had marginally significantly deeper litter depth, lower abundance of native plants with ranges limited to western North America, and lower abundance of amphibians. In contrast to these differences, eucalypt and oak groves had very similar bird community composition, species richness, and abundance. We found no evidence of ""invasional meltdown,"" documenting similar abundance and richness of nonnatives in eucalypt vs. oak woodlands. Our time-series analysis revealed that planted eucalypt groves increased 271% in size, on average, over six decades, invading adjacent areas. Our results inform science-based management of California woodlands, revealing that while bird communities would probably not be affected by restoration of eucalypt to oak woodlands, such a restoration project would not only stop the spread of eucalypts into adjacent habitats but would also enhance cover by western North American native plants and perennials, enhance amphibian abundance, and increase arthropod richness."

However, resource limitation is not of overriding importance in all systems, as exemplified by marine soft sediments, one of Earth's most widespread habitat types. Here, we tested the disturbance-invasion hypothesis in a marine soft-sediment system by altering rates of biogenic disturbance and tracking the natural colonization of plots by invasive species. Levels of sediment disturbance were controlled by manipulating densities of burrowing spatangoid urchins, the dominant biogenic sediment mixers in the system. Colonization success by two invasive species (a gobiid fish and a semelid bivalve) was greatest in plots with sediment disturbance rates <500 cm(3).m(-2).d(-1), at the low end of the experimental disturbance gradient (0 to >9000 cm(3).m(-2).d(-1)). Invasive colonization declined with increasing levels of sediment disturbance, counter to the disturbance-invasion hypothesis. Increased sediment disturbance by the urchins also reduced the richness and diversity of native macrofauna, (particularly small, sedentary, surface feeders), though there was no evidence of increased availability of resources with increased disturbance that would have facilitated invasive colonization: sediment food resources (chlorophyll a and organic matter content) did not increase, and space and access to overlying water were not limited (low invertebrate abundance). Thus, our study revealed the importance of biogenic disturbance in promoting invasion resistance in a marine soft-sediment community, providing further evidence of the valuable role of bioturbation in soft-sediment systems (bioturbation also affects carbon processing, nutrient recycling, oxygen dynamics, benthic community structure, and so on.). Bioturbation rates are influenced by the presence and abundance of large burrowing species (like spatangoid urchins). Therefore, mass mortalities of large bioturbators could inflate invasion risk and alter other aspects of ecosystem performance in marine soft-sediment habitats."

However, it is often not possible to determine important introduction details, such as date, number of organisms, and introduction location when examining factors affecting invasion success. Here we use biological control introduction data to assess the role of propagule pressure, disturbance, and residence time on invasion success of four herbivorous insect species introduced for the control of the invasive wetland plant, Lythrum salicaria, in the Columbia River Estuary. Two sets of field surveys determined persistence at prior release sites, colonization of new sites, and abundance within colonized sites. We quantified propagule pressure in four ways to examine the effect of different measurements. These included three measurements of introduction size (proximity to introduction site, introduction size at a local scale, and introduction size at a regional scale) and one measure of introduction number (number of introduction events in a region). Disturbance was examined along a tidal inundation gradient (distance from river mouth) and as habitat (island or mainland).

There was colonization by about 10% of the species that were introduced in totals of under 5,000 individuals, 40% of those introduced in totals of between 5,000 and 31,200, and 78% of those introduced in totals of over 31,200. Indications exist that initial colonizations may be favoured by large releases and by selection of release sites that are semi-isolated and not ecologically complex but that colonizations are hindered when the target species differs taxonomically from the species from which introduced agents originated and when the release site lacks factors needed for introduced agents to survive or when it is subject to potentially-avoidable physical disruptions. There was no evidence that the probability of colonization was increased when the numbers of individuals released were increased by laboratory propagation. About 10% of the attempts were successful from the economic viewpoint. Successes may be overestimated if the influence of causes of coincidental, actual, or supposed changes in pest abundance are overlooked. Most of the successes were by two or more kinds of agents of which at least one attacked species additional to the target pests. Unplanned consequences of colonization have not been sufficiently harmful to warrant precautions to the extent advocated by Turnbull and Chant but are sufficiently potentially dangerous to warrant the restriction of all colonization attempts to biological control experts. It is concluded that most failures were caused by inadequate procedures, rather than by any weaknesses inherent in the method, that those inadequacies can be avoided in the future, and therefore that biological control of pest insects has much unrealized potential for use in Canada."

Invasion by alien species is especially likely to occur on oceanic islands. To determine how alien species become integrated into island plant-insect associations, we analyzed the structure of tree-beetle associations using host plant records for larval feeding by wood-feeding beetles (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) on the oceanic Ogasawara Islands in the northwestern Pacific Ocean. The host plant records comprised 109 associations among 28 tree (including 8 alien) and 26 cerambycid (including 5 alien) species. Of these associations, 41.3% involved at least one alien species. Most native cerambycid species feed on host trees that have recently died. Alien trees were used by as many native cerambycid species (but by significantly more alien cerambycid species) as were native trees. Native cerambycid species used as many alien tree species (but significantly more native tree species) as did alien cerambycids. Thus, we observed many types of interactions among native and alien species. A network analysis revealed a significant nested structure in tree-cerambycid associations regardless of whether alien species were excluded from the analysis. The original nested associations on the Ogasawara Islands may thus have accepted alien species."

Among them, nine species can be considered as invasive, i.e., playing a conspicuous role in the recipient ecosystems, taking the place of keystone species and/or being economically harmful: Acrothamnion preissii, Asparagopsis armata, Lophocladia lallemandii, Womersleyella setacea (Rhodophyta), Sargassum muticum, Stypopodium schimperi (Fucophyceae), Caulerpa racemosa, Caulerpa taxifolia and Halophila stipulacea (Plantae). These data fit well the Williamson and Fitter's ""tens rule"", which states that, on average, 1 out of 10 introduced species becomes invasive. Though some features (e.g. life traits, geographical origin) can increase the likelihood of a successful invasion, the success of invaders is far from being predictable. Since the beginning of the 20th century, the number of introduced species to the Mediterranean has nearly doubled every 20 years. Should these kinetics continue, and according to the tens rule, it can be expected that 5-10 newly introduced macrophytes shall become invasive in the next 20 years. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Conversely, the biotic acceptance hypothesis states that non-native and native species richness are positively related. Most tests of these hypotheses at continental scales, typically conducted on plants, have found support for biotic acceptance. We tested these hypotheses on both amphibians and reptiles across Europe and North America. Location Continental countries in Europe and states/provinces in North America. Methods We used multiple linear regression models to determine which factors predicted successful establishment of amphibians and reptiles in Europe and North America, and additional models to determine which factors predicted native species richness. Results Successful establishment of amphibians and reptiles in Europe and reptiles in North America was positively related to native species richness. We found higher numbers of successful amphibian species in Europe than in North America. Potential evapotranspiration (PET) was positively related to non-native species richness for amphibians and reptiles in Europe and reptiles in North America. PET was also the primary factor determining native species richness for both amphibians and reptiles in Europe and North America. Main conclusions We found support for the biotic acceptance hypothesis for amphibians and reptiles in Europe and reptiles in North America, suggesting that the presence of native amphibian and reptile species generally indicates good habitat for non-native species. Our data suggest that the greater number of established amphibians per native amphibians in Europe than in North America might be explained by more introductions in Europe or climate-matching of the invaders. Areas with high native species richness should be the focus of control and management efforts, especially considering that non-native species located in areas with a high number of natives can have a large impact on biological diversity."

The relationship between invader success and richness, however, seems to be positive at large scales of analysis, determined by abiotic constraints, and it is to be expected that it is negative at small scales, because of biotic interactions. Moreover, the negative relationship at small scales would be stronger within species of the same functional group, because of having similar resource exploitation mechanisms. We studied the relationship between the cover of a worldwide invader of grasslands, Hieracium pilosella L., and species richness, species diversity and the cover of different growth forms at two different levels of analysis in 128 sites during the initial invasion process in the Fuegian steppe, Southern Patagonia, Argentina. At regional level, the invader was positively correlated to total (r=0.28, P=0.003), exotic (r=0.273, P=0.004), and native species richness (r=0.210, P=0.026), and to species diversity (r=0.193, P=0.041). At community level, we found only a weak negative correlation between H.pilosella and total richness (r=0.426, P=0.079) and diversity (r=0.658, P=0.063). The relationship between the invader and other species of the same growth form was positive both at regional (r=0.484, P<0.001) and community (r=0.593, P=0.012) levels. Consequently, in the period of establishment and initial expansion of this exotic species, our results support the idea that invader success is related to abiotic factors at large scales of analysis. Also, we observed a possible sign of biotic constraint at community level, although this was not related to the abundance of species of the same growth form."

Without the debilitating effects of these pests, alien species often display greater fitness and vigour than they show in their home range. Yet the advantage conferred by this escape is not universally shared: alien plants can encounter novel biotic hazards or barriers in the new range for which they lack defence. For some aliens these new barriers are so extreme as to repeatedly preclude naturalization. Despite a general awareness that such 'fortuitous biological control' can occur, it has not been comprehensively documented, even in agriculture. These barriers can be illustrated among a taxonomically diverse group of alien plants, particularly in tropical forestry. Indirect, floristic evidence further supports a role of biotic agents in thwarting naturalizations. Among state and regional floras in the USA, naturalized species that are members of previously unrepresented genera in these floras are often more common than naturalized congeners of natives. These distributions among genera support the contention that naturalization is enhanced for alien species that lack native relatives. Such phylogenetic distance could minimize the likelihood of host extension or shift among the native pests that have co-evolved with native plants. The current fragmentary information for the roles of biotic barriers leads to opposing conclusions: (i) the infrequency of these cases means they are much less important than physical barriers in thwarting naturalization; or (ii) they are important but routinely overlooked because small, immigrant populations are quickly destroyed by pests in the new range."

We monitored damage experienced by S. virgaurea planted into communities with native congeners and without close relatives. Community type was crossed with a vegetation removal treatment to assess the combined effects of herbivory and competition on survival. We also evaluated growth of S. virgaurea in a greenhouse experiment where seedlings were exposed to soil biota sampled from these communities and compared with sterile controls. Overall, community type did not affect levels of herbivory or plant survival. Removal of surrounding vegetation resulted in reduced damage and increased survival; these effects were largest in grass-dominated communities. Soil sterilization reduced root growth and tended to reduce shoot growth, especially when compared with plants inoculated with biota collected near congeners. Overall, our results suggest that the presence of close relatives is unlikely to make old-field communities more resistant to invasion by S. virgaurea; instead, soil biota might facilitate growth in communities dominated by close relatives."

A natural colonizer, the autogamous, invasive orchid Spathoglottis plicata has acquired at least three interspecific interactions in Puerto Rico: a mycorrhizal fungus essential for seed germination and early development; a native, orchid-specialist weevil, Stethobaris polita, which eats perianth parts and oviposits in developing fruits; and ants, primarily invasive Solenopsis invicta, that forage at extrafloral nectaries. We tested in field experiments and from observational data whether weevils affect reproductive success in the orchid; and whether this interaction is density-dependent. We also examined the effectiveness of extrafloral nectaries in attracting ants that ward off weevils. Only at small spatial scales were weevil abundance and flower damage correlated with flower densities. Plants protected from weevils had less floral damage and higher fruit set than those accessible to weevils. The more abundant ants were on inflorescences, the less accessible fruits were to weevils, resulting in reduced fruit loss from larval infections. Ants did not exclude weevils, but they affected weevil activity. Native herbivores generally provide some biotic resistance to plant invasions yet Spathoglottis plicata remains an aggressive colonizer despite the acquisition of a herbivore/seed predator partly because invasive ants attracted to extrafloral nectaries inhibited weevil behavior. Thus, the invasion of one species facilitates the success of another as in invasional meltdowns. For invasive plant species of disturbed habitats, having ant-tended extrafloral nectaries and producing copious quantities of seed, biotic resistance to plant invasions can be minimal."

I investigated the roles of experimental manipulation of understorey species richness and overstorey characteristics in resistance to invader establishment in a floodplain forest in south-western Virginia, USA. 2 I manipulated resident species richness in experimental plots along a flooding gradient, keeping plot densities at their original levels, and quantified the overstorey characteristics of each plot. 3 After manipulating the communities, I transplanted 10 randomly chosen invaders from widespread native and non-native forest species into the experimental plots. Success of an invasion was measured by survival and growth of the invader. 4 Native and non-native invader establishment trends were influenced by different aspects of the biotic community and these relationships depended on the site of invasion. The most significant influence on non-native invader survival in this system of streamside and upper terrace plots was the overstorey composition. Non-native species survival in the flooded plots after 2 years was significantly positively related to proximity to larger trees. However, light levels did not fully explain the overstorey effect and were unrelated to native survivorship. The effects of understorey richness on survivorship depended on the origin of the invaders and the sites they were transplanted into. Additionally, native species growth was significantly affected by understorey plot richness. 5 The direction and strength of interactions with both the overstorey (for non-native invaders) and understorey richness (for natives and non-natives) changed with the site of invasion and associated environmental conditions. Rather than supporting the hypothesis of biotic resistance to non-native invasion, my results suggest that native invaders experienced increased competition with the native understorey plants in the more benign upland habitat and facilitation in the stressful riparian zone."

However, little is known of predators' preferences for seeds of indigenous or non-indigenous plant species or how seed predation varies across communities. We hypothesize that seed predation does not differ between indigenous and non-indigenous plant species and that seed predation is positively related to plant species diversity in the resident community. The seed removal of 36 indigenous and non-indigenous grassland species in seven extensively or intensively managed hay meadows across Switzerland covering a species-richness gradient of 18-50 plant species per unit area (c. 2 m2) was studied. In mid-summer 2011, c. 24,000 seeds were exposed to predators in Petri dishes filled with sterilized soil, and the proportions of seeds removed were determined after three days' exposure. These proportions varied among species (9.2-62.5%) and hay meadows (17.8-48.6%). Seed removal was not related to seed size. Moreover, it did not differ between indigenous and non-indigenous species, suggesting that mainly generalist seed predators were active. However, seed predation was positively related to plant species richness across a gradient in the range of 18-38 species per unit area, representing common hay meadows in Switzerland. Our results suggest that generalist post-dispersal seed predation contributes to biotic resistance and may act as a filter to plant invasion by reducing the propagule pressure of non-local plant species."

Its success in pioneer environments is determined by constraints on its reproduction. We determined whether pollinators were required for seed set in C scoparius at Barrington Tops, NSW, Australia, where the species has infested ca. 14000 ha across the plateau. Field and laboratory experiments showed that C scoparius is an obligate outcrossing species at Barrington Tops. Monitoring of plants (10.7 h) showed that the flowers of C scoparius have to be tripped to effect seed set and the only pollinator to do this was the introduced honeybee, Apis mellifera L. Most floral visits by honeybees result in fruit set (84%) and because fruits have many ovules (10-18 per ovary) a single bee on an average foraging day can effect the production of over 6000 seeds. A review of C scoparius pollination across four continents revealed major differences in pollen quantity, which may explain differences in the efficiencies of honeybees as pollinators of C. scoporius. The incorporation of pollinator management in an integrated approach for the control of C scoparius is discussed."

In Argentina, the ant Camponotus punctulatus invades agricultural fields after production ceases. The temporal demography and spatial distribution of colonies of C. punctulatus were studied over a five year period using replicated plots of different land use types representing a gradient of increasing agricultural disturbance. We experimentally tested the hypothesis that the increase in C punctulatus colony density was related to increasing levels of agricultural disturbance. Abandoned rice fields represented the situation with greatest disturbance. Sown pastures were intermediate. Natural grasslands represented no agricultural disturbance. The predictions were (1) the greater the soil disturbance produced by agriculture, the greater the susceptibility for invasion by C. punctulatus, (2) rice fields offers greater opportunities for establishment of colonizing species than sown pastures, and (3) disturbed land use areas that were more recently colonized as well as land use areas with greater soil disturbance will exhibit patterns of colony aggregation at a small scale but with time the patterns will become uniform. Initially, colonies in the abandoned rice fields had a higher annual mortality and larger turnover than in sown pastures. Over five years, abandoned rice fields sustained higher densities of colonies than sown pastures. The colonies were the largest and had the longest lifespans in abandoned ricefields. Natural grasslands had the lowest colony density, survivorship, and size but had variable levels of colonization. More than one type of spatial distribution was found in field replicates. At small spatial scales across disturbed land use types, replicates exhibited regular distributions. At greater spatial scales, spatial distributions were mostly random in sown pastures, there were many cases of aggregation in rice fields, although some cases of uniform distributions were also found in all disturbed land uses. These results highlight significant intraspecific variation in ant demography across types of land use, space, and time, and show a clear predisposition of C punctulatus to invade and successfully establish in the most disturbed land use types. Hypotheses that can account for the changes in demography across land use types are discussed."

Passively dispersing non-indigenous organisms, including zooplankton, seemingly invade constructed waters (e.g., ornamental ponds, dams and reservoirs) at faster rates than natural lakes. A common attribute of these invaded water bodies is their relatively young age, leading to the assertion that low biotic resistance may lead to their higher vulnerability. Our aim was to determine if seeding of young water bodies with sediments containing diapausing stages of native zooplankton could accelerate community development, leading to greater biotic resistance to the establishment of new species. Twenty outdoor tanks were filled with water (1,400L) and nutrients added to attain eutrophic conditions. Ten treatment tanks had sediments added, sourced from local water bodies. In the remaining ten, sediments were autoclaved, and received zooplankton via natural dispersal only. In an initial 12month monitoring period, species richness increased at a greater rate in the treatment tanks (at 12months average standing richness per tank=3.8, accumulated richness=8.2) than control tanks (2.6 and 5.0, P<0.05). Treatment tanks developed assemblages with greater proportions of species adapted to pelagic conditions, such as planktonic cladocerans and copepods, while control tanks generally comprised of smaller, littoral dwelling, rotifers. Analysis of similarities indicated community composition differed between the control and treatment groups at 12months (P<0.01). Two copepod, four rotifer and one cladoceran species were intentionally added to tanks at 12months. In the 3month post-introduction period, five of these species established populations in the control tanks, while only two species established in the treatment tanks. The calanoid copepod Skistodiaptomus pallidus, for example, a non-indigenous species confined to constructed waters in New Zealand, established exclusively in tanks where native calanoid copepod species were absent (primarily control tanks). Our study suggests that biotic resistance could play an important role in reducing the establishment rate of non-indigenous zooplankton. It also provides evidence that seeding constructed water bodies with sediments containing diapausing eggs of native species may provide an effective management tool to reduce establishment rates of non-indigenous zooplankton.

All three invaders have a common native range in North America and are widespread in and around Donana in SW Spain. Using laboratory experiments, we compared the predation rates by the two exotic fish and native Odonata larvae on Trichocorixa and the native Sigara lateralis. We found no evidence to suggest that Trichocorixa suffers lower predation rates. However, when both corixids were mixed together, predation of Trichocorixa by Odonata larvae was higher. Odonata larvae were size-limited predators and the proportion of corixids ingested was positively correlated with mask length. Since Trichocorixa is smaller than its native competitors, this may explain their higher susceptibility to predation by Odonata. This may be one of various factors explaining why Trichocorixa is particularly dominant in saline habitats where Odonata are rare, while it is still scarce in fresh waters."

We tested the enemy release hypothesis by first comparing 20 populations of L. vulgare and 27 populations of L. ircutianum in their native range in Europe, and then comparing the European L. vulgare populations with 31 L. vulgare populations sampled in North America. Characteristics of the site and associated vegetation, plant performance and invertebrate herbivory were recorded. In Europe, plant height and density of the two species were similar but L. vulgare produced more flower heads than L. ircutianum. Leucanthemum vulgare in North America was 17 % taller, produced twice as many flower heads and grew much denser compared to L. vulgare in Europe. Attack rates by root- and leaf-feeding herbivores on L. vulgare in Europe (34 and 75 %) was comparable to that on L. ircutianum (26 and 71 %) but higher than that on L. vulgare in North America (10 and 3 %). However, herbivore load and leaf damage were low in Europe. Cover and height of the co-occurring vegetation was higher in L. vulgare populations in the native than in the introduced range, suggesting that a shift in plant competition may more easily explain the invasion success of L. vulgare than escape from herbivory."

Those introductions offered a unique opportunity to compare in situ the fate of two closely related fish in the same habitat. 3. Our major aims were to assess whether G. gobio was able to establish in what seemed an unlikely environment, to compare populations trends and life-history traits of both species and to assess whether we could explain or could have predicted our results, by considering their life-history strategies. 4. Data show that both species have established in the canal and have spread. Catches of P. parva have increased strongly and are now higher than those of G. gobio. 5. The two cyprinids have the same breeding season and comparable traits (such as short generation time, small body, high reproductive effort), so both could be classified as opportunists. The observed difference in their success (in terms of population growth and colonization rate) could be explained by the wider ecological and physiological tolerance of P. parva. 6. In conclusion, our field study seems to suggest that invasive vigour also results from the ability to tolerate environmental changes through phenotypic plasticity, rather than from particular life-history features pre-adapted to invasion. It thus remains difficult to define a good invader simply on the basis of its life-history features."

The effects of physical environmental factors, especially the type of agricultural canals, on the invasive freshwater snail Pomacea canaliculata were studied at 33 sites in the Chikugogawa River basin, Kyushu, Japan. Differences among sites in the local fauna and vegetation were also monitored. Structural equation modeling with a model selection procedure revealed that canals with a concrete lining had more snails. The effect was indirect in that the concrete lining reduced animal species richness and increased the invasive waterweed Egeria densa, which may serve as a refuge, protecting the snails from predation. A tethering experiment conducted simultaneously indicated high predation pressure on the snails: over 20% of the tethered snails were lost within a day. Thus, human impacts may increase biological invasion by reducing biotic resistance and increasing the risk of invasional meltdown."

Grazing activities may facilitate the spread of invasive cane toads (Rhinella marina) through tropical Australia by providing year-round access to otherwise-seasonal resources. We quantified the cane toad's use of cowpats (feces piles) in the field, and conducted experimental trials to assess the potential role of cowpats as sources of prey, water, and warmth for toads. Our field surveys show that cane toads are found on or near cowpats more often than expected by chance. Field-enclosure experiments show that cowpats facilitate toad feeding by providing access to dung beetles. Cowpats also offer moist surfaces that can reduce dehydration rates of toads and are warmer than other nearby substrates. Livestock grazing is the primary form of land use over vast areas of Australia, and pastoral activities may have contributed substantially to the cane toad's successful invasion of that continent."

Accordingly, invasion may well affect regenerative phases of the community, especially at the seed bank level, likely influencing community restoration. Pyracantha angustifolia (Rosaceae) is an invasive shrub in central Argentina that affects woody recruitment, particularly enhancing the recruitment of other exotic woody species. There is though no information regarding its effect on the soil seed bank within the invaded community. The present study was set up to gain further insight into the canopy effects of P. angustifolia. We aimed to assess whether the invasive shrub affects seed bank composition, richness and seed density as compared with the dominant native shrub Condalia montana (Rhamnaceae), and to relate the observed seed bank patterns with those of the established vegetation. We evaluated the composition of the germinable seed bank and the established vegetation under the canopy of 16 shrubs of P. angustifolia, 16 shrubs of C. montana, and in 16 control plots (10 m(2)) without shrub cover. The floristic composition of the seed bank differed among canopy treatments. However, seed bank richness did not differ significantly. There was an overall high seed density of exotic species throughout the study site, though exotic forbs showed significantly lower seed densities under the invasive shrub. Pyracantha angustifolia would not promote the incorporation of new species into the seed bank of the invaded community but rather favour the establishment of woody species that do not depend on seed banks. The absence of dominant woody species in the seed bank, the dominance of exotic forbs, and the high similarity between established exotic species and those present in the seed bank may surely affect community restoration following the main disturbances events observed in the region."

This pest species is rapidly spreading in European Russia and is likely to arrive in other countries soon. The aim is to analyze the ecological consequences of the establishment of this pest in European Russia and investigate (1) what other xylophagous beetles develop on trees affected by A. planipennis, (2) how common is the parasitoid of the emerald ash borer Spathius polonicus (Hymenoptera: Braconidae: Doryctinae) and what is the level of parasitism by this species, and (3) how susceptible is the native European ash species Fraxinus excelsior to A. planipennis. A survey of approximately 1000 Fraxinus pennsylvanica trees damaged by A. planipennis in 13 localities has shown that Hylesinus varius (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae), Tetrops starkii (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) and Agrilus convexicollis (Coleoptera: Buprestidae) were common on these trees. Spathius polonicus is frequently recorded. About 50 percent of late instar larvae of A. planipennis sampled were parasitized by S. polonicus. Maps of the distributions of T. starkii, A. convexicollis and S. polonicus before and after the establishment of A. planipennis in European Russia were compiled. It is hypothesized that these species, which are native to the West Palaearctic, spread into central European Russia after A. planipennis became established there. Current observations confirm those of previous authors that native European ash Fraxinus excelsior is susceptible to A. planipennis, increasing the threat posed by this pest. The establishment of A. planipennis has resulted in a cascade of ecological effects, such as outbreaks of other xylophagous beetles in A. planipennis-infested trees. It is likely that the propagation of S. polonicus will reduce the incidence of outbreaks of A. planipennis."

Our main objective is to find evidence to support the notion that disturbances, particularly forest fires, are important driving factors in the current expansion of A. dealbata. Area of study: We mapped it current distribution using three study areas and assesses the temporal changes registered in forest cover in these areas of the valley of the river Mino. Material and methods: The analyses were based on visual interpretation of aerial photographs taken in 1985 and 2003 of three 1 x 1 km study areas and field works. Main result: A 62.4%, 48.6% and 22.2% of the surface area was covered by A. dealbata in 2003 in pure or mixed stands. Furthermore, areas composed exclusively of A. dealbata make up 33.8%, 15.2% and 5.7% of the stands. The transition matrix analyses between the two dates support our hypothesis that the areas currently covered by A. dealbata make up a greater proportion of the forest area previously classified as unwooded or open forest than those without A. dealbata cover. Both of these surface types are the result of an important impact of fire in the region. Within each area, A. dealbata is mainly located on steeper terrain, which is more affected by fires. Research highlights: A. dealbata is becoming the dominant tree species over large areas and the invasion of this species gives rise to monospecific stands, which may have important implications for future fire regimes."

The additions represent taxa newly recorded since 2002 and reported in the national literature; taxa resulting from investigation of sources omitted while preparing the previous catalogue; redetermination of previously reported taxa; reassessment of some taxa traditionally considered native for which the evidence suggests the opposite; and inclusion of intraspecific taxa previously not recognized in the flora. There are 44 taxa on the list that are reported in the present study for the first time as aliens introduced to the Czech Republic or escaped from cultivation: Abies concolor, A. grandis, A. nordmanniana, Avena sterilis subsp. ludoviciana, A.  vilis, Berberis julianae, B. thunbergii, Bidens ferulifolius, Buddleja alternifolia, Buglossoides incrassata subsp. splitgerberi, Buxus sempervirens, Corispermum declinatum, Cotoneaster dielsianus, C. divaricatus, Euphorbia myrsinites, Gleditsia triacanthos, Helleborus orientalis, Hieracium heldreichii, Koelreuteria paniculata, Lonicera periclymenum, Lotus ornithopodioides, Malus baccata, M. pumila, Miscanthus sacchariflorus, Morus alba, Muscari armeniacum, Paeonia lactiflora, Pennisetum alopecuroides, Pinguicula crystallina subsp. hirtiflora, P. grandiflora subsp. rosea, Podophyllum hexandrum, Pyracantha coccinea, Rhodotypos scandens, Rumex patientia   R. tianschanicus 'Uteuša', Salix cordata, Sarracenia purpurea, Sasa palmata 'Nebulosa', Scolymus maculatus, Spiraea japonica, Tagetes tenuifolia, Thuja occidentalis, Trifolium badium, Vaccinium corymbosum and Viburnum rhytidophyllum. All added and deleted taxa are commented on. Of the total number of taxa, 985 are classified as casuals, 408 as naturalized but not invasive, and 61 as invasive. The reduction in the number of invasive taxa compared to the previous catalogue is due to a more conservative approach adopted here; only taxa that currently spread are considered invasive. Casual taxa are strongly overrepresented among neophytes compared to archaeophytes (76.7% vs 39.4%), while naturalized but non-invasive taxa follow the reversed pattern (18.8% vs 57.4). However, these two groups do not significantly differ in the proportion of invasive taxa. Of introduced neophytes, 250 taxa (22.6%) are considered vanished, i.e. no longer present in the flora, while 23.3% became naturalized, and 4.5% invasive. In addition to the traditional classification based on introduction-naturalization-invasion continuum, taxa were classified into 18 population groups based on their long-term trends in metapopulation dynamics in the country, current state of their populations, and link to the propagule pressure from cultivation. Mapping these population groups onto the unified framework for biological invasions introduced by Blackburn et al. in 2011 made it possible to quantify invasion failures, and boom-and-busts, in the Czech alien flora. Depending on inclusion criteria (whether or not extinct/vanished taxa and hybrids are considered), alien taxa ever recorded in the Czech Republic contribute 29.7-33.1% to the total country's plant diversity; taking into account only naturalized taxa, a permanent element of the country's flora, the figure is 14.4-17.5%. Analysis of the dates of the first record, known for 771 neophytes, indicates that alien taxa in the flora have been increasing at a steady pace without any distinct deceleration trend; by extrapolating this data to all 1104 neophytes recorded it is predicted that the projected number would reach 1264 in 2050. Deliberate introduction was involved in 747 cases (51.4%), the remaining 48.6% of taxa are assumed to have arrived by unintentional pathways. Archaeophytes are more abundant in landscapes, occupy on average a wider range of habitat types than neophytes, but reach a lower cover in plant communities. The alien flora is further analysed with respect to representation of genera and families, origin and life history."

It was considered as a suitable substitute tree species in areas where afforestation with the native Norway spruce had not been successful, e.g. in areas heavily affected by air pollution. Young plantations of blue spruce were healthy, without serious insect damage. We studied the moth associates of blue spruce (Picea pungens) and Norway spruce {Picea abies) in the two distant regions (study areas) in Central Europe represented by West Carpathians (Veporske vrchy Mountains, Central Slovakia) and Hercynian Mountains (Decinska vrchovina hills, north-west Bohemia) and addressed the questions as to whether ( 1 ) blue spruce and Norway spruce have similar moth fauna, (2) blue spruce planted in forests is a host for Coleotechnites piceaella (the moth already recorded in urban areas in Central Europe) and/or other moth species introduced from North America and (3) afforestation with the introduced blue spruce affects the diversity of Lepidoptera on the native Norway spruce. Over the growing season 2006 (West Carpathians) and 2007 (Hercynian Mountains) the beating method was used to collect caterpillars from the lower branches of blue spruce and Norway spruce. In addition, photoeclectors in the laboratory were used to record moth caterpillars (or hatched adults) overwintering on blue spruce and Norway spruce in the two study areas in March 2008. The sample branches of blue spruce and Norway spruce were placed into photoeclectors. Moth specimens that had emerged from photoeclectors were collected and identified. A total of 998 caterpillars (or hatched adults) were collected from blue spruce, and a total of 860 caterpillars (or hatched adults) were obtained from Norway spruce. The moth fauna on blue spruce was similar to that on Norway spruce. Blue spruce and Norway spruce were found to host equal number of moth species (31 species). All species recorded on blue spruce are developing on the native Norway spruce. Comparisons between blue spruce and Norway spruce revealed some differences in the species composition of caterpillar assemblages. A significantly higher abundance of needle spinning larvae (Batrachedridae, Gelechiidae and Tortricidae) and significantly lower abundance of bud-boring larvae (genus Argyresthia, Yponomeutidae) on blue spruce compared to Norway spruce, was the most pronounced difference. No moth species introduced from North America were recorded. Based on the results, the introduction of blue spruce to the Central European forests is only slightly influencing the diversity of moth assemblages on Norway spruce."

It is crucial for successful conservation to differentiate factors supporting species' current distributions from those triggering range dynamics. Here, we studied the sudden extralimital colonization of the rose chafer beetle, Oxythyrea funesta, in the Czech Republic. Specifically, we depicted the range expansion using accumulated historical records of first known occurrences and then explained the colonization events using five transformed indices depicting changes in local propagule pressure (LPP), climate, land use, elevation, and landscape structure. The slow occupancy increase of O. funesta before 1990 changed to a phase of rapid occupancy increase after 1990, driven not only by changes in the environment (climate and land use) but also by the spatial accumulation of LPP. Climate was also found to play a significant role but only during the niche-filling stage before 1990, while land use became important during the phase of rapid expansion after 1990. Inland waters (e.g., riparian corridors) also contributed substantially to the spread in the Czech Republic. Our method of using spatially transformed variables to explain the colonization events provides a novel way of detecting factors triggering range dynamics. The results highlight the importance of LPP in driving sudden occupancy increase of extralimital species and recommend the use of LPP as an important predictor for modeling range dynamics."

To avoid or overcome the loss of mutualists, plants may co-invade with nonnative mutualists, form novel associations with native mutualists or form associations with native cosmopolitan mutualists, which are native but not novel to the invading plant. We tested these hypotheses by contrasting the ectomycorrhizal fungal communities associated with invasive Pinus contorta in New Zealand with co-occurring endemic Nothofagus solandri var. cliffortioides. Fungal communities on Pinus were species poor (14 ectomycorrhizal species) and dominated by nonnative (93%) and cosmopolitan fungi (7%). Nothofagus had a species-rich (98 species) fungal community dominated by native Cortinarius and two cosmopolitan fungi. These results support co-invasion by mutualists rather than novel associations as an important mechanism by which plants avoid or overcome the loss of mutualists, consistent with invasional meltdown."

Toxic bait was used to exclude A. gracilipes from large (9-35 ha) forest patches. Within 11 weeks, ant activity on the ground and on trunks had been reduced by 98-100%, while activity on control plots remained unchanged. The exclusion of ants caused a 100% decline in the density of scale insects in the canopies of three rainforest trees in 12 months (Inocarpus fagifer, Syzygium nervosum and Barringtonia racemosa), but on B. racemosa densities of scale insects also declined in control plots, resulting in no effect of ant exclusion on this species. This study demonstrates the role of positive interactions in facilitating biological invasions, and supports recent models calling for greater recognition of the role of positive interactions in structuring ecological communities."

The geographic distribution and density of L. aristata and of its native congeneric L. bisulcata were assessed in four areas of Brazil (24 sites), additionally considering their relationship with types of substrate, depth and wave exposure. This study records the first occurrence of L. aristata in the Sepetiba Bay and also reports the species at five new localities in the Arraial do Cabo Bay. Lithophaga aristata is established in the four surveyed regions. At intertidal habitats, the exotic species only colonizes the infralittoral fringe but its density was not related to wave action. At subtidal habitats, the species colonizes natural and artificial substrates, from shallow (0.5m) to deep (5.0-7.0m) zones but no relationship between density and these evaluated factors was detected. Broad geographical and ecological distributions and higher densities of this introduced species in relation to its native congeneric are suggested as contrary to Darwin's naturalization hypothesis and instead indicate a high invasiveness potential."

The best way to assess colonizing ability is by making experimental introductions of the species and monitoring the outcome. In this study, different-sized propagules of Roesel's bush-cricket, Metrioptera roeseli, were experimentally introduced into 70 habitat islands, previously uninhabited by the species, in farmland fields in southeastern Sweden. The areas of introduction were carefully monitored for 2-3 yr to determine whether the propagules had successfully colonized the patches. The study showed that large propagules resulted in larger local populations during the years following introduction. Probability of colonization for each propagule size was measured and showed that propagule size had a significant effect on colonization success, i.e., large propagules were more successful in colonizing new patches. If future introductions were to be made with this or a similar species, a propagule size of at least 32 individuals would be required to establish a viable population with a high degree of certainty."

Alien and common species achieved greater biomass than native and rare species did overall respectively. Across alien and native origins, common species increased total biomass more strongly in response to nutrient addition than rare species did and this difference was not confounded by habitat dissimilarities. There was a weak tendency for common species to survive competition better than rare species, which was also independent of origin.

In our experiment, species in each of four functional guilds were introduced, as seed, into 147 prairie-grassland plots that previously had been established and maintained to have different compositions and diversities. Established species most strongly inhibited introduced species from their own functional guild. introduced species attained lower abundances when functionally similar species were abundant and when established species left lower levels of resources unconsumed, which occurred at lower species richness. Residents of the C4 grass functional guild, the dominant guild in nearby native grasslands, reduced the major limiting resource, soil nitrate, to the lowest levels in midsummer and exhibited the greatest inhibitory effect on introduced species. This simple mechanism of greater competitive inhibition of invaders that are similar to established abundant species could, in theory, explain many of the patterns observed in plant communities."

An important question is how to create restored communities that can better resist reinvasion by these weeds. One hypothesis is that communities comprised of species that are functionally similar to the invader will best resist invasion, while an alternative hypothesis is that structurally more complex and diverse communities will result in more effective competitive exclusion. In this field experiment, we examined the effects of restored community structure on the invasion success of three annual grass weeds (downy brome, jointed goatgrass, and cereal rye). We created replicated community plots that varied in species composition, structural complexity and density, then seeded in annual grass weeds and measured their biomass and seed production the following year, and their cover after 1 and 3 yr. Annual grass weeds were not strongly suppressed by any of the restored communities, indicating that it was difficult for native species to completely capture available resources and exclude annual grass weeds in the first years after planting. Perennial grass monocultures, particularly of the early seral grass bottlebrush squirreltail, were the most highly invaded communities, while structurally complex and diverse mixtures of shrubs (big sagebrush, rubber rabbitbrush), perennial grasses (bluebunch wheatgrass and bottlebrush squirreltail) and forbs (Lewis flax, Utah sweetvetch, hairy golden aster, gooseberryleaf globemallow) were more resistant to invasion. These results suggest that restoration of sagebrush steppe communities resistant to annual grass invasion benefits from higher species diversity; significant reduction of weed propagule pressure prior to restoration may be required."

Five hemipteran sap feeders were found only on S. altissima. Two of them, the aphid Uroleucon nigrotuberculatum Olive (Hemiptera: Aphididae) and the scale insect Parasaissetia nigra Nietner (Hemiptera: Coccidae), were exotic species, accounting for 62% of the total individuals on S. altissima. These exotic sap feeders mostly determined the difference of community composition on the two plant species. In contrast, the herbivore community on S. virgaurea consisted predominately of five native insects: two lepidopteran leaf chewers and three dipteran leaf miners. Overall species richness did not differ between the plants because the increased species richness of sap feeders was offset by the decreased richness of leaf chewers and leaf miners on S. altissima. The overall density of herbivorous insects was higher on S. altissima than on S. virgaurea, because of the high density of the two exotic sap feeding species on S. altissima. We discuss the importance of analyzing community composition in terms of feeding guilds of insect herbivores for understanding how communities of insect herbivores are organized on introduced plants in novel habitats."

This study has aimed to identify the clues for its success by defining the structural and functional characteristics of plant communities in different stages of succession with and without Hovenia dulcis. Following the general assumptions of invasion ecology, we expected that Hovenia dulcis establishment and invasion success would be significantly higher in early successional communities, with high resource availability and low species richness and diversity, as well as low functional diversity. Contrary to this hypothesis, no differences were found between plant communities invaded and non-invaded by Hovenia dulcis at three different succession stages. No relationship was found between species richness and diversity and functional diversity, with respect to invasibility along the successional gradient. Hovenia dulcis is strongly associated with semi-open vegetation, where the species was found in higher density. The invasion of open vegetation is more recent, providing evidence of the species's ability to invade plant communities in early successional stages. We concluded that the colonization by Hovenia dulcis was associated with forest openness, but the species is also able to colonize semi-open vegetation, and persist in the successionally more advanced communities."

Indeed, the presence of one nonindigenous species can act as an agent of disturbance that facilitates the invasion of a second species. However, most studies of nonindigenous species are anecdotal and do not provide substantive evidence that interactions among nonindigenous species have any community-level effects. Here, using a combination of field experiments and observations we examine interactions among introduced species in New England kelp forests and ask whether these interactions have altered paradigms describing subtidal communities in the Gulf of Maine. The green alga Codium fragile was observed at the Isles of Shoals, Maine, USA, in 1983 and has since replaced the native kelp as the dominant seaweed on leeward shores. Experiments manipulating kelp and Codium reveal that Codium does not directly inhibit growth or survival of kelp. Codium does, however, successfully recruit to gaps in the kelp bed and, once established, inhibits recruitment of kelp. A second nonindigenous species, Membranipora membranacea, grows epiphytically on kelp, and experiments reveal that the presence of Membranipora reduces growth and survival of kelp, resulting in defoliation of kelp plants and gap formation in kelp beds. In the absence of Codium, kelp recolonizes these gaps, but when present, Codium colonizes and prevents kelp recolonization. Manipulations of herbivores demonstrate that herbivory will reinforce Codium dominance. Thus, the demise of New England kelp beds appears to result from one invasive species facilitating the spread of a second nonindigenous species."

Both species were identified as predacious omnivores with high dietary overlap and a generalistic feeding strategy. Amphipods (especially invasive Dikerogammarus spp.) contributed 2/3 to the index of food importance. delta N-15-signatures of N. melanostomus revealed an ontogenetic diet shift and significantly exceeded those in P. kessleri by similar to 1.5aEuro degrees, indicating a niche separation of half a trophic level. P. kessleri had shorter uncoiled intestinal tracts than N. melanostomus, indicating a narrower niche and adaptation to animal food. Trophic niches in both species expanded during the growth period with increasing intraguild predation and cannibalism in P. kessleri and increasing molluscivory in N. melanostomus. P. kessleri showed a higher degree of specialization and more stable feeding patterns across seasons, whereas N. melanostomus adapted its diet according to the natural prey availability. The feeding patterns of both species observed in the upper Danube River strongly differ from those in their native ranges, underlining their great plasticity. Both goby species consumed mainly other non-native species (similar to 92% of gut contents) and seemed to benefit from previous invasions of prey species like Dikerogammarus villosus. The invasive success of gobies and their prey mirror fundamental ecological changes in large European freshwater ecosystems."

Overall, we found that the native species sustain 56.4% more overall leaf damage and 83.6% more herbivore-related leaf damage when compared to the exotic species. Moreover, we found that the invasive exotic species sustained less damage from enemies relative to their corresponding native species than the noninvasive exotic species. Finally, we found that burning and nitrogen fertilization both significantly increased the prevalence of rust fungi in the native grass, while rust fungi rarely occurred on the exotic grass. These results indicate that reduced damage from enemies may in part explain the successful naturalization of exotic species and the spread of invasive exotic species in tallgrass prairie."

A loss of natural enemies, such as parasites, is one mechanism proposed to contribute to that success. While several studies have shown NIS are initially less parasitized than native conspecifics, fewer studies have investigated whether parasite richness changes over time. Moreover, evaluating the role that parasites have in invaded communities requires not only an understanding of the parasite diversity of NIS but also the species with which they interact; yet parasite diversity in native species may be inadequately quantified. In our study, we examined parasite taxonomic richness, infection prevalence, and infection intensity in the invasive Asian shore crab Hemigrapsus sanguineus De Haan, 1835 and two native mud crabs (Panopeus herbstii Milne-Edwards, 1834 and Eurypanopeus depressus Smith, 1869) in estuarine and coastal communities along the east coast of the USA. We also examined reproductive tissue allocation (i.e., the proportion of gonad weight to total body weight) in all three crabs to explore possible differences in infected versus uninfected crabs. We found three parasite taxa infecting H. sanguineus and four taxa infecting mud crabs, including a rhizocephalan castrator (Loxothylacus panopaei) parasitizing E. depressus. Moreover, we documented a significant negative relationship between parasite escape and time for H. sanguineus, including a new 2015 record of a native microphallid trematode. Altogether, there was no significant difference in taxonomic richness among the crab species. Across parasite taxa, H. sanguineus demonstrated significantly lower infection prevalence compared to P. herbstii; yet a multivariate analysis of taxa-specific prevalence demonstrated no significant differences among crabs. Finally, infected P. herbstii had the highest proportion of gonad weight to total body weight. Our study finds some evidence for lower infection prevalence in the non-native versus the native hosts. However, we also demonstrate that parasite escape can lessen with time. Our work has implications for the understanding of the potential influence parasites may have on the future success of NIS in introduced regions."

Since its accidental introduction onto the South African west coast in the late 1970s, it has become the most successful marine invasive species in South Africa. One possible explanation for this phenomenon is that M. galloprovincialis suffers less from phototrophic shell-degrading endoliths in its invasive than in its native range. We assessed photoautotrophic endolithic pressure on M. galloprovincialis in native (Portugal) and invasive (South Africa) ranges. Invasive populations were more heavily infested than native populations. In Portugal, only the biggest/oldest mussels displayed endolithic erosion of the shell and the incidence of infestation was greater at higher shore levels where more prolonged exposure to light enhances endolith photosynthesis. In South Africa, even the smallest size classes of mussels were heavily infested throughout the shore. In Portugal, endolithic-induced mortality was observed at only one location, while in South Africa it occurred at all locations and at significantly higher rates than in Portugal. Important sub-lethal effects were detected in infested native mussels, confirming previous studies of invasive populations and suggesting an energy trade-off between shell repair and other physiological constraints. We observed a positive relationship between infestation rates and barnacle colonization on mussel shells, suggesting possible facilitation of barnacle settlement/survival by shell-boring pathogens. Identification of endoliths revealed common species between regions. However, two species were unique in the invasive range while another was unique in the native region. Different levels of endolithic infestation in the invasive and the native range were not explained by the effect of major environmental determinants (Photosynthetically Available Radiation and wave height). The results reject our initial hypothesis, indicating that invasion success of M. galloprovincialis is not simply explained by escape from its natural enemies but results from complex interactions between characteristics of the invaded community and properties of the invader."

Biological invasions threaten ecosystem integrity and biodiversity, with numerous adverse implications for native flora and fauna. Established populations of two notorious freshwater invaders, the snail Tarebia granifera and the fish Pterygoplichthys disjunctivus, have been reported on three continents and are frequently predicted to be in direct competition with native species for dietary resources. Using comparisons of species' isotopic niche widths and stable isotope community metrics, we investigated whether the diets of the invasive T.granifera and P.disjunctivus overlapped with those of native species in a highly invaded river. We also attempted to resolve diet composition for both species, providing some insight into the original pathway of invasion in the Nseleni River, South Africa. Stable isotope metrics of the invasive species were similar to or consistently mid-range in comparison with their native counterparts, with the exception of markedly more uneven spread in isotopic space relative to indigenous species. Dietary overlap between the invasive P.disjunctivus and native fish was low, with the majority of shared food resources having overlaps of <0.26. The invasive T.granifera showed effectively no overlap with the native planorbid snail. However, there was a high degree of overlap between the two invasive species (0.86). Bayesian mixing models indicated that detrital mangrove Barringtonia racemosa leaves contributed the largest proportion to P.disjunctivus diet (0.12-0.58), while the diet of T.granifera was more variable with high proportions of detrital Eichhornia crassipes (0.24-0.60) and Azolla filiculoides (0.09-0.33) as well as detrital Barringtonia racemosa leaves (0.00-0.30). Overall, although the invasive T.granifera and P.disjunctivus were not in direct competition for dietary resources with native species in the Nseleni River system, their spread in isotopic space suggests they are likely to restrict energy available to higher consumers in the food web. Establishment of these invasive populations in the Nseleni River is thus probably driven by access to resources unexploited or unavailable to native residents."

The invader showed constantly higher performance (relative growth rate and total biomass) across irradiances than its native congeners. Higher light-saturated photosynthetic rate (P-max), respiration efficiency (RE), and nitrogen (PNUE) and water (WUE, at 40% and 100% irradiances only) use efficiencies contributed directly to the higher performance of the invader. Higher nitrogen allocation to, stomatal conductance, and the higher contents of leaf nitrogen and pigments contributed to the higher performance of the invader indirectly through increasing P-max, RE, PNUE and WUE. The invader had consistently higher plasticity only in carotenoid content than its native congeners in ranges of low (10-40%), high (40-100%) and total (10-100%) irradiances, contributing to invasion success in high irradiance by photo protection. In the range of low irradiances, the invader had higher plasticity in some physiological traits (leaf nitrogen content, nitrogen contents in bioenergetics, carboxylation and in light-harvesting components, and contents of leaf chlorophylls and carotenoids) but not in performance, while in the ranges of high or total irradiances, the invader did not show higher plasticity in any variable (except Car). The results indicated that the relationship between invasiveness and plasticity of a specific trait was complex, and that a universal generalization about the relationship might be too simplistic.

We compared the relative competitiveness of native perennial and exotic annual grasses in a California coastal prairie grassland to test whether the introduction of exotic propagules to coastal grasslands in the 19th century was likely to have been sufficient to shift community composition from native perennial to exotic annual grasses. Under experimental field conditions, we compared the aboveground productivity of native species alone to native species competing with exotics, and exotic species alone to exotic species competing with natives. Over the course of the four-year experiment, native grasses became increasingly dominant in the mixed-assemblage plots containing natives and exotics. Although the competitive interactions in the first growing season favored the exotics, over time the native grasses significantly reduced the productivity of exotic grasses. The number of exotic seedlings emerging and the biomass of dicot seedlings removed during weeding were also significantly lower in plots containing natives as compared to plots that did not contain natives. We found evidence that the ability of established native perennial species to limit space available for exotic annual seeds to germinate and to limit the light available to exotic seedlings reduced exotic productivity and shifted competitive interactions in favor of the natives. If interactions between native perennial and exotic annual grasses follow a similar pattern in other coastal grassland habitats, then the introduction of exotic grass propagules alone without changes in land use or climate, or both, was likely insufficient to convert the region's grasslands."

Five fertilization rates were tested for monocultures and two for mixtures where six combinations of planting densities were used in two seasons (spring and fall). Monitoring of plant biomass was made at the end of each of these 2-month-experiments. In contrast to E. densa, clear seasonal patterns in biomass production and in reproductive allocations of H. verticillata were evident. Competitive pressure for both species was lower during the fall experiment. Biomass production increased with fertilization for H. verticillata in monocultures and changes either in allocative ratios or in tuber production patterns were shown in response to nutrient availability. However, E. densa growth was not affected by fertilization. In most cases, H. verticillata was a better competitor than E. densa except when sediment was pure sand. Competition occurred mainly for nutrient uptake rather than for light harvesting. These results suggest that despite the similar ecology, H. verticillata may outcompete E. densa in many situations, probably due to its higher plasticity."

A series of competition experiments under ambient and elevated CO2 glasshouse conditions were conducted to determine an index of relative competition intensity for 14 native-invasive exotic species-pairs. Traits including specific leaf area, leaf mass ratio, leaf area ratio, relative growth rate, net assimilation rate and root weight ratio were measured. Competitive rankings within species-pairs were not affected by CO2 concentration: invasive exotic species were more competitive in 9 of the 14 species-pairs and native species were more competitive in the remaining 5 species-pairs, regardless of CO2 concentration. However, there was a significant interaction between plant type and CO2 treatment due to reduced competitive response of native species under elevated compared with ambient CO2 conditions. Native species had significantly lower specific leaf area and leaf area ratio under elevated compared with ambient CO2. We also compared traits of more-competitive with less-competitive species, regardless of plant type, under both CO2 treatments. More-competitive species had smaller leaf weight ratio and leaf area ratio, and larger relative growth rate and net assimilation rate under both ambient and elevated CO2 conditions. These results suggest that growth and allocation traits can be useful predictors of the outcome of competitive interactions under both ambient and elevated CO2 conditions. Under predicted future atmospheric CO2 conditions, competitive rankings among species may not change substantially, but the relative success of invasive exotic species may be increased. Thus, under future atmospheric CO2 conditions, the ecological and economic impact of some invasive exotic plants may be even greater than under current conditions."

We found that the frequency of unionid infestation by Dreissena recently declined, and the number of dreissenids attached to unionids in the lower Great Lakes has fallen almost ten-fold since the early 1990s. We also found that the rate of infestation depends on the dominant Dreissena species in the lake: zebra mussels infested unionids much more often and in greater numbers.

Genotypes from native and introduced ranges of S. inaequidens showed the same responses to spatial pattern. By contrast, genotypes from the introduced range of C. stoebe did not respond to spatial pattern whereas native ones did. Based on phenotypic plasticity, we argue that the two target species adopted different strategies to deal with the spatial pattern of the resident plant community. We show that effects of spatial pattern of the resident community on the fitness of establishing species may depend on the diversity of the recipient community. Our results highlight the need to consider the interaction between invasiveness and invasibility in order to increase our understanding of invasion success."

Here, we examine the effects of human activities, species traits and characteristics of the invaded range on spread rates using a global sample of alien reptile and amphibian introductions. We show that spread rates vary remarkably among invaded locations within a species, and differ across biogeographical realms. Spread rates are positively related to the richness of native congeneric species and human-assisted dispersal in the invaded range but are negatively correlated with topographic heterogeneity. Our findings highlight the importance of environmental characteristics and human-assisted dispersal in developing robust frameworks for predicting species' range shifts."

Their ranges and dispersal rates vary across Europe, which may result from their interspecific interactions, accelerating or reducing migrations. We checked this hypothesis by testing interference competition among co-occurring invaders: Dikerogammarus villosus, D. haemobaphes and Pontogammarus robustoides. We used 140-cm long tanks (gravel substratum), divided into seven compartments. We introduced 25 ""residents"" into the outermost compartment, separated with a barrier. After 1h, we introduced 25 ""intruders"". After the next 1h, we removed the barrier and the gammarids dispersed in the tank. After 4 or 20h, we counted the gammarids in the compartments. We tested all pairwise species combinations and single-species controls. Dikerogammarus villosus displaced other species (P. robustoides only after 4h) and reduced its own motility after 20h in their presence. Pontogammarus robustoides stimulated the short-time migrations of D. villosus intruders and of D. haemobaphes. As P. robustoides migrated spontaneously much more than Dikerogammarus spp., its impact decreased after longer time. Dikerogammarus haemobaphes stimulated the short-time movement of P. robustoides intruders but reduced the long-time relocation of this species. In general, gammarid dispersal increased in the presence of stronger competitors (D. villosus and P. robustoides, especially residents) and decreased in response to weaker competitors (D. haemobaphes). Thus, competitive interactions may affect dispersal of invasive gammarids and contribute to the fastest spread of the weakest competitor, D. haemobaphes observed in the field, whereas the strongest species, D. villosus was the latest newcomer in many novel areas."

Tree clearing, cultivation and pasture improvement have led to fragmentation of this once relatively continuous ecosystem, leaving a series of remnants which themselves have been modified by livestock grazing. Little-modified remnants are extremely rare. We examined and compared the effects of fragmentation and disturbance on the understorey flora of woodland remnants, through a survey of remnants of varying size, grazing history and tree clearing. In accordance with fragmentation theory, species richness generally increased with remnant size, and, for little-grazed remnants, smaller remnants were more vulnerable to weed invasion. Similarly, tree clearing and grazing encouraged weed invasion and reduced native species richness. Evidence for increased total species richness at intermediate grazing levels, as predicted by the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, was equivocal. Remnant quality was more severely affected by grazing than by remnant size. All little-grazed remnants had lower exotic species abundance and similar or higher native species richness than grazed remnants, despite their extremely small sizes (< 6 ha). Further, small, little grazed remnants maintained the general character of the pre-European woodland understorey, while grazing caused changes to the dominant species Although generally small, the little-grazed remnants are the best representatives of the pre-European woodland understorey, and should be central to any conservation plan for the woodlands. Selected larger remnants are needed to complement these, however, to increase the total area of woodland conserved, and, because most little-grazed remnants are cleared, to represent the ecosystem in its original structural form. For the maintenance of native plant diversity and composition in little-grazed remnants, it is critical that livestock grazing continues to be excluded. For grazed remnants, maintenance of a site in its current state would allow continuation of past management, while restoration to a pre-European condition would require management directed towards weed removal, and could take advantage of the difference noted in the predominant life-cycle of native (perennial) versus exotic (annual or biennial) species."

(Poaceae) is an African grass that is invading mid-elevation Trachypogon savannas in Venezuela. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of soil fertility, competition and soil disturbance in facilitating Melinis' invasion and growth in these savanna sites. We manipulated soil fertility by adding nitrogen (+N), phosphorus and potassium (+PK), or nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (+NPK). We simultaneously manipulated the competitive environment by clipping background vegetation. In a separate experiment, we mechanically disrupted the soil to simulate disturbance. We hypothesized that germination and growth were bottlenecks to early establishment in undisturbed savanna, but that disturbance would alleviate those bottlenecks. We measured Melinis seed germination and subsequent establishment by adding seeds to all plots. We examined Melinis growth by measuring biomass of Melinis seedling transplants, 11 months after they were placed into treatment plots. Germination and establishment of Melinis from seed was extremely low. Of the 80,000 seeds applied in the experiment, only 28 plants survived the first growing season. Mortality of Melinis seedling transplants was lowest in PK fertilized plots, but in the absence of PK mortality increased with N additions and clipping. By contrast, fertilization of the savanna with NPK greatly increased Melinis seedling biomass and this effect was greatly enhanced when competition was reduced ( e. g. clipping). Melinis transplant growth responded strongly to soil disturbance-a response not fully explained by removal of competitors ( clipping) or changes in soil nutrients and moisture. We suspect that disruption of the soil structure allowed for greater root proliferation and subsequent plant growth. We believe that native savanna is relatively resistant to Melinis invasion, since Melinis seedlings persisted in intact savanna but exhibited little or no growth during the first year. The significant enhancement of Melinis seedling growth with clipping and nutrient additions suggests that low soil nutrients and the presence of native savanna species are important factors in the ability of native savanna to establishment. However, the potential for Melinis growth increases enormously with soil disturbance."

Recently, this predator of bivalves has been spreading all around the world oceans, probably helped by ship traffic and aquaculture trade. A caging experiment in natural environment was performed during the summer of 2002 in Cesenatico (Emilia-Romagna, Italy) in order to estimate consumption rates and prey preference of R. venosa. The prey items chosen were the Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis (Lamarck 1819), the introduced carpet clam Tapes philippinarum (Adams and Reeve 1850), both supporting the local fisheries, and the Indo-Pacific invasive clam Anadara (Scapharca) inaequivalvis (Bruguiere 1789). Results showed an average consumption of about 1 bivalve prey per day (or 1.2 g wet weight per day). Predation was species and size selective towards small specimens of A. inaequivalvis; consumption of the two commercial species was lower. These results might reduce the concern about the economical impact on the local bivalve fishery due to the presence of the predatory gastropod. On the other hand, selective predation might probably alter local community structure, influencing competition amongst filter feeder/suspension feeder bivalve species and causing long-term ecological impact. The large availability of food resource and the habitat characteristics of the Emilia-Romagna littoral makes this area an important breeding ground for R. venosa in the Mediterranean Sea, thus worthy of consideration in order to understand the bioinvasion ecology of this species and to control its likely further dispersal."

It is not known, however, to what extent their effects on biodiversity change as their cover increases, and how these effects may differ depending on the environmental context. Experimental plots with increasing cover of oysters were established within two estuaries in two different habitats commonly inhabited by C. gigas, (mussel-beds and mud-flats) and were sampled after 4 and 15 months. Within mud-flat habitats, macroscopic species living on or in the substratum increased in richness, Shannon-Wiener diversity and number of individuals with oyster cover. In mussel-bed habitats, however, these indices were unaffected by the cover of oysters except at one estuary after 15 months when species richness was significantly lower in plots with the greatest cover of oysters. Assemblage structure differed with oyster cover in mud-flats but not in mussel-beds, except at 100 % cover in one location and at one time. Within mud-flats at one location and time (of four total tests), assemblages became more homogenous with increasing cover of oysters leading to a significant decrease in beta-diversity. These responses were primarily underpinned by the facilitation of several taxa including a grazing gastropod (Littorina littorea), an invasive barnacle (Austrominius modestus) and a primary producer (Fucus vesiculosus) with increasing cover of oysters. Although there were consistent positive effects of C. gigas on mud-flat biodiversity, effects were weak or negative at higher cover on mussel-beds. This highlights the need for the impacts of invasive species to be investigated at a range of invader abundances within different environmental contexts."

At least part of this difference may be contributed by differences in non-biological factors, such as the antiquity and intensity of human impacts and the absence of internal barriers to dispersal, rather than differences in inherent invasibility. We tested the resistance of species-rich continental rain forests to plant invasion on a small, continental island that has been subject to prolonged and intensive human impact. Location Singapore is a 683-km(2) equatorial island <1 km from the Asian mainland and with a population of 4 million people. It has a continental biota but has been subject to human impacts as intense as on any oceanic island. Methods We sampled twenty-nine sites in seven vegetation types, ranging from urban wasteland to fragments of primary lowland rain forest. In each sample plot, all plant species were identified, exotic cover was estimated, and a range of environmental variables measured. Additional qualitative surveys for exotic invasion were made in other forest areas in Singapore. The data were analysed by Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Results The number of exotic species recorded at a site was unrelated to the number of native species. Across all sites, percentage canopy opening had the highest correlation with the number of exotic species, while soil pH (which largely reflects the incorporation of calcareous construction wastes) had the highest correlation if the mangrove sites were excluded. There were no exotics in mangrove forest and only a tropical American, bird-dispersed shrub, Clidemia hirta (L.) D. Don (Melastomataceae: Koster's Curse), in primary and tall secondary forest patches. The species-poor early stages of woody plant succession on highly degraded soils were also very resistant to exotic plant invasion. Main conclusions Long-isolated rain forest fragments in an exotic-dominated continental island landscape resist invasion by exotic plants, suggesting that the problems on oceanic islands may reflect an inherently greater invasibility. This study also adds to the increasing evidence that the floras of tropical rain forest fragments in South-east Asia are remarkably resilient on a time-scale of decades to a century or more."

Here we examine this hypothesis in the context of grassland restoration, which faces two major obstacles: the contingency of native grass establishment on unpredictable precipitation, and competition from introduced species. We established replicated restoration experiments over three years at two sites in the northern Great Plains in order to examine the extent to which the success of several restoration strategies varied between sites and among years. We worked in 50-yr-old stands of crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum), an introduced perennial grass that has been planted on > 10 x 10(6) ha in western North America. Establishment of nativegrasses was highly contingent on local conditions, varying fourfold among years and threefold between sites. Survivorship also varied greatly and increased significantly with summer precipitation. No consistent differences were found between drilling and broadcasting in their effects on. establishment, but survivorship was nearly threefold higher in broadcast plots. Plots without seed added, or with native hay added, had almost. no seedlings of native grasses. In contrast, broadcasting the residue remaining after cleaning seeds from native hay produced the highest seedling densities of any treatment. Competition from A. cristatum was significantly and consistently reduced through annual application of a generalist herbicide (glyphosate), which increased native grass establishment and survivorship and the richness and total cover of native species. Herbicide decreased standing crop and increased soil moisture and available nitrogen. A. cristatum was controlled without suppressing native vegetation, both by spraying in early spring, which selectively killed the cool-season A. cristatum, and by application with a wick, which selectively killed the taller A. cristatum. A. cristatum persisted over four years, however, in spite of annual herbicide application. A. cristatum cover in control plots increased significantly with summer precipitation. In summary, broadcasting and drilling differed little in their effects on establishment, but broadcasting increased survivorship and will allow the emergence of plant-induced heterogeneity. Competition from introduced species can be reduced but not eliminated by continuing herbicide application. Lastly, the positive relationships between precipitation and both A. cristatum and native seedling survivorship suggest that management should focus on controlling A. cristatum during dry years and on introducing native species during wet years."

Understanding of the functioning of invaded ecosystems will benefit from careful investigation of resulting species-level interactions. We manipulated ant visitation to compare how invasive ant mutualisms affect two common plants, one native and one invasive, on a sub-tropical Indian Ocean island. Technomyrmex albipes, an introduced species, was the most common and abundant ant visitor to the plants. T. albipes were attracted to extrafloral nectaries on the invasive tree (Leucaena leucocephala) and deterred the plant's primary herbivore, the Leucaena psyllid (Heteropsylla cubana). Ant exclusion from L. leucocephala resulted in decreased plant growth and seed production by 22% and 35%, respectively. In contrast, on the native shrub (Scaevola taccada), T. albipes frequently tended sap-sucking hemipterans, and ant exclusion resulted in 30% and 23% increases in growth and fruit production, respectively. Stable isotope analysis confirmed the more predacious and herbivorous diets of T. albipes on the invasive and native plants, respectively. Thus the ants' interactions protect the invasive plant from its main herbivore while also exacerbating the effects of herbivores on the native plant. Ultimately, the negative effects on the native plant and positive effects on the invasive plant may work in concert to facilitate invasion by the invasive plant. Our findings underscore the importance of investigating facilitative interactions in a community context and the multiple and diverse interactions shaping novel ecosystems."

However, little is known about how herbivorous insects on non-native plants are exposed to carnivorous insects, and even less is known on plants that have recently expanded their ranges within continents due to climate warming. In this study we examine the herbivore load (herbivore biomass per plant biomass), predator load (predator biomass per plant biomass) and predator pressure (predator biomass per herbivore biomass) on an inter-continental non-native and an intra-continental range-expanding plant species and two congeneric native species. All four plant species co-occur in riparian habitat in north-western Europe. Insects were collected in early, mid and late summer from three populations of all four species. Before counting and weighing the insects were classified to trophic guild as carnivores (predators), herbivores, and transients. Herbivores were further subdivided into leaf-miners, sap-feeders, chewers and gallers. Total herbivore loads were smaller on inter-continental non-native and intra-continental range-expanding plants than on the congeneric natives. However, the differences depended on time within growing season, as well as on the feeding guild of the herbivore. Although the predator load on non-native plants was not larger than on natives, both non-native plant species had greater predator pressure on the herbivores than the natives. We conclude that both these non-native plant species have better bottom-up as well as top-down control of herbivores, but that effects depend on time within growing season and (for the herbivore load) on herbivore feeding guild. Therefore, when evaluating insects on non-native plants, variation within season and differences among feeding guilds need to be taken into account."

To document the spread of both introduced species along the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia from initial introduction points (the 'epicentre') southwest of Halifax, we conducted video-surveys of shallow rocky habitats along the southwestern shore of Nova Scotia (100 km linear distance, encompassing the range of M. membranacea) in 2000, and then along the entire Atlantic coast in 2007 (650 km). Membranipora membranacea was observed continuously throughout the surveyed ranges in 2000 and 2007, wherever kelps were present, suggesting natural dispersal via planktonic larvae. Codium fragile was observed along 95 km of the surveyed range in 2000 and along 445 km in 2007, with a relatively patchy distribution beyond the epicentre, suggesting a combination of natural and anthropogenic dispersal mechanisms. Rockweed-dominated (Fucus spp.) or mixed algal assemblages common outside the epicentre may alter the interaction between M. membranacea and C. fragile, since seaweeds other than kelp are not subject to defoliation by the bryozoan. Percent cover of kelp at the epicentre generally increased from 2000 to 2007, while that of C. fragile generally decreased. Codium fragile was the dominant canopy alga at 54% of sites in 2000 and at only 15% of sites in 2007. These findings indicate that, at near decadal timescales, C. fragile does not prevent re-colonization by native kelps."

In particular, it is unclear what role plasticity versus adaptive evolution plays in enabling exotics to persist under new environmental circumstances in the introduced range. We determined the extent to which native and introduced populations of St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) are genetically differentiated with respect to leaf-level morphological and physiological traits that allow plants to tolerate different climatic conditions. In common gardens in Washington and Spain, and in a greenhouse, we examined clinal variation in percent leaf nitrogen and carbon, leaf delta C-13 values (as an integrative measure of water use efficiency), specific leaf area (SLA), root and shoot biomass, root/shoot ratio, total leaf area, and leaf area ratio (LAR). As well, we determined whether native European H. perforatum experienced directional selection on leaf-level traits in the introduced range and we compared, across gardens, levels of plasticity in these traits. In field gardens in both Washington and Spain, native populations formed latitudinal clines in percent leaf N. In the greenhouse, native populations formed latitudinal clines in root and shoot biomass and total leaf area, and in the Washington garden only, native populations also exhibited latitudinal clines in percent leaf C and leaf delta C-13. Traits that failed to show consistent latitudinal clines instead exhibited significant phenotypic plasticity. Introduced St. John's Wort populations also formed significant or marginally significant latitudinal clines in percent leaf N in Washington and Spain, percent leaf C in Washington, and in root biomass and total leaf area in the greenhouse. In the Washington common garden, there was strong directional selection among European populations for higher percent leaf N and leaf delta C-13, but no selection on any other measured trait. The presence of convergent, genetically based latitudinal clines between native and introduced H. perforatum, together with previously published molecular data, suggest that native and exotic genotypes have independently adapted to a broad-scale variation in climate that varies with latitude."

For a given community, however, immigration processes may impact diversity by means of two separable components: the number of species represented in seed inputs and the density of seed per species. The independent effects of these components on plant species diversity and consequent rates of invasion are poorly understood. We constructed experimental plant communities through repeated seed additions to independently measure the effects of seed richness and seed density on the trajectory of species diversity during the development of annual plant communities. Because we sowed species not found in the immediate study area, we were able to assess the invasibility of the resulting communities by recording the rate of establishment of species from adjacent vegetation. Early in community development when species only weakly interacted, seed richness had a strong effect on community diversity whereas seed density had little effect. After the plants became established, the effect of seed richness on measured diversity strongly depended on seed density, and disappeared at the highest level of seed density. The ability of surrounding vegetation to invade the experimental communities was decreased by seed density but not by seed richness, primarily because the individual effects of a few sown species could explain the observed invasion rates. These results suggest that seed density is just as important as seed richness in the control of species diversity, and perhaps a more important determinant of community invasibility than seed richness in dynamic plant assemblages."

The parallel dynamics (PD) hypothesis predicts that regional occurrence patterns of exotic species will be similar to native species. Together, the CSS and PD hypotheses may increase our understanding of exotic species' distribution relative to natives. We selected an old field undergoing secondary succession to study the CSS and PD hypotheses in conjunction with each other. The ratio of exotic to native species (richness and abundance) was observed through 17 years of secondary succession. We predicted species would be bimodally distributed and that exotic:native species ratios would remain steady or decrease through time under frequent disturbance. In contrast to the CSS and PD hypotheses, native species occupancies were not bimodally distributed at the site, but exotic species were. The exotic:native species ratios for both richness (E:N-richness) and abundance (E:N-cover) generally decreased or remained constant throughout supporting the PD hypothesis. Our results suggest exotic species exhibit metapopulation structure in old field landscapes, but that metapopulation structures of native species are disrupted, perhaps because these species are dispersal limited in the fragmented landscape."

A. planipennis overwinters primarily as a freeze-avoiding prepupa within the outer xylem or inner bark of the host tree. The range of this species is expanding outward from its presumed introduction point in southwestern Michigan. We hypothesized that loss of cold tolerance in response to mid-winter warm spells could limit survival and northern distribution of A. planipennis. We determined whether winter-acclimatised A. planipennis prepupae reduced their cold tolerance in response to mid-winter warm periods, and whether this plasticity was reversible with subsequent cold exposure. Prepupae subjected to mid-winter warm spells of 10 and 15C had increased supercooling points (SCPs) and thus reduced cold tolerance. This increase in SCP was accompanied by a rapid loss of haemolymph cryoprotectants and the loss of cold tolerance was not reversed when the prepupae were returned to -10C. Exposure to temperatures fluctuating from 0 to 4C did not reduce cold hardiness. Only extreme warming events for several days followed by extreme cold snaps may have lethal effects on overwintering A. planipennis populations. Thus, distribution in North America is likely to be limited by the presence of host trees rather than climatic factors, but we conclude that range extensions of invasive species could be halted if local climatic extremes induce unidirectional plastic responses.

The burrowing crab Chasmagnathus granulata eats Spartina densiflora, and also causes several geomorphologic changes that indirectly affect Spartina growth. Here we evaluate if this crab affects the sexual reproductive effort of S. densiflora by mediating changes in plant phenotypic plasticity (i.e., shape of leaves and spikes) while affecting aboveground production, and if these effects interact with disturbance intensity. We conducted local and regional surveys and two-year field experiments manipulating the density of crabs in a mature Spartina marsh where we clipped at ground level different I x I in marsh areas to create and compare crab's effect on young (plants growing after the clipping) and mature (unclipped) Spartina stands. Our results suggest that crabs mediate the phenotypic plasticity of sexual reproductive structures of Spartina. Crabs induced an increase in seed production (up to 721%) and seed viability, potentially favoring Spartina dispersal and colonization of distant sites. This effect appears to be maximal when combined with the experimental clipping disturbance. Crabs also exerted a strong effect on clipped plants by increasing the number of standing dead stems and decreasing the photosynthetic area and leaf production. These effects disappear in about two years if no other disturbance occurs. An a posteriori regional field survey agreed with our experimental results corroborating the prediction that plants in old undisturbed marshes have lower sexual reproductive effort than plants in highly disturbed marshes populated by burrowing-herbivore crabs. All these phenotypic changes have important taxonomic and macro-ecological implications that should not be ignored in discussions of applied ecology and environmental management.

By combining data on boating activity water body physicochemistry, and geographical distribution of five nuisance invaders in the Laurentian Great Lakes region, we show that non-indigenous species are 2.4 to 300 times more likely to occur in impoundments than in natural lakes, and that impoundments frequently support multiple invaders.

Probability of naturalization was positively related to the number of native species in a genus but negatively related to native congener abundance, suggesting the importance of both niche availability and biotic resistance. Once naturalized, however, exotic abundance was not related to the number of native congeners, but positively related to native congener abundance.

The success of nonnative species may be influenced by their relatedness to the native flora. Darwin proposed that if a nonnative plant species is introduced into an environment without native congeners, the nonnative species will have a greater chance of becoming naturalized. To test Darwin's naturalization hypothesis, we compiled a Kentucky plant database consisting of 821 vascular plant species and subsequently selected species traits and distribution information to determine the effect of congeneric species and traits on the probability of successful naturalization and invasion. The predictors used include reproductive traits, growth form, abundance, habitat type, native congeners, and biogeographical origin. We fit three sets of generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) with a binomial family and a logit link. Backward selection based on minimizing the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) was used in the analyses. Our results from these three sets of models clearly indicate that the validity of Darwin's hypothesis is invasion stage dependent. More specific, the naturalized and invasive models (predicting the probability of being naturalized and invasive respectively) did not support Darwin's naturalization hypothesis. The number of native congeners had no effect on the likelihood that a particular species would naturalize and become invasive. Our results suggest that Darwin's naturalization hypothesis is more relevant during the early stage of establishment as demonstrated by the native model (predicting the probability of being native) and it becomes irrelevant during the late stages of invasion as indicated by the naturalized and invasive models. Thus, it can be generalized that biotic interactions, especially competition, is a critical determinant of initial success for nonnative species in the recipient communities. Once established, the fate of nonnative species during the late stages of invasion may be more related to other factors such as biogeographic origin and habitat conditions. Furthermore, we found reproductive traits such as flowering phenology and flower type are associated with invasion success. We also recognized contrasting traits between native and nonnative species, indicating niche differentiation between these two groups of species. Niche overlapping was found as well among species regardless of the status of being native or otherwise. Our study provides a novel approach to advance the understanding of phylogenetic relatedness between nonnative species and native flora by integrating traits and niche concepts at the regional scale."

Although this theory predicts that exotic species should be less diverse in regions that contain more native species, macroecological analyses often find that the correlation between exotic and native species richness is positive rather than negative. To reconcile results with theory, we explore to what extent climatic conditions, landscape heterogeneity and anthropogenic disturbance may explain the positive relationship between native and exotic plant richness. Location Catalonia (western Mediterranean region). Methods We integrated floristic records and GIS-based environmental measures to make spatially explicit 10-km grid cells. We asked whether the observed positive relationship between native and exotic plant richness (R-2 = 0.11) resulted from the addition of several negative correlations corresponding to different environmental conditions identified with cluster analysis. Moreover, we directly quantified the importance of common causal effects with a structural equation modelling framework. Results We found no evidence that the relationship between native and exotic plant richness was negative when the comparison was made within environmentally homogeneous groups. Although there were common factors explaining both native and exotic richness, mainly associated with landscape heterogeneity and human pressure, these factors only explained 17.2% of the total correlation. Nevertheless, when the comparison was restricted to native plants associated with human-disturbed (i.e. ruderal) ecosystems, the relationship was stronger (R-2 = 0.52) and the fraction explained by common factors increased substantially (58.3%). Main conclusions While our results confirm that the positive correlation between exotic and native plant richness is in part explained by common extrinsic factors, they also highlight the great importance of anthropic factors that - by reducing biotic resistance - facilitate the establishment and spread of both exotic and native plants that tolerate disturbed environments."

A common belief in invasion ecology is that invasive species are a major threat to biodiversity, but there is little evidence yet that competition from an exotic plant species has led to the extinction of any native plant species at the landscape scale. However, effects of invasive species at community and ecosystem levels can severely compromise conservation goals. 2. Our model species, the red quinine tree (Cinchona pubescens), was introduced to the Galapagos Islands in the 1940s and today extends over at least 11 000 ha in the highlands of Santa Cruz Island. It is also invasive on other oceanic islands. 3. We adopted a long-term approach, analysing permanent plots in the Fern-Sedge vegetation zone over 7 years, to test for impacts of C. pubescens density on resident plant species composition and on microclimate variables. We also tested whether the C. pubescens invasion facilitated the invasion of other species. 4. The rapid pace of the C. pubescens invasion was indicated by a more than doubling of percentage cover, a 4.6-fold increase in mean stand basal area and a 4-fold increase in the number of stems ha-1 in 7 years. 5. Photosynthetically active radiation was reduced by 87% under the C. pubescens canopy while precipitation increased because of enhanced fog interception. 6. Cinchona pubescens significantly decreased species diversity and the cover of most species by at least 50%. Endemic herbaceous species were more adversely affected than non-endemic native species. Stachys agraria, another invasive species, colonized bare ground that developed under the C. pubescens canopy. 7. The numbers of native, endemic and introduced species in the study area remained constant throughout the 7-year period. 8. Synthesis. This study clearly established C. pubescens as a habitat transformer, although its average cover did not exceed 20%. Despite the fact that no plant species has been lost completely from the study area so far, the introduction of the novel tree life form to a formerly treeless environment led to significant changes in stand structure and environmental conditions and to decreases in species diversity and cover. Such changes clearly conflict with conservation goals as set by the Convention on Biological Diversity."

I examine the exotic New Zealand ant fauna for characteristics that predict or determine an exotic species' ability to establish. Quarantine records show interceptions of 66 ant species: 17 of which have established, 43 have faded to establish, whereas nests of another six are periodically observed but have failed to establish permanently (called 'ephemeral' establishment). Mean temperature at the highest latitude and interception variables were the only factors significantly different between established, failed or ephemeral groups. Aspects of life history, such as competitive behaviour and morphology, were not different between groups. However, in a stepwise discriminant analysis, small size was a key factor influencing establishment success. Interception rate and climate were also secondarily important. The resulting classification table predicted establishment success with 71% accuracy. Because not all exotic species are represented in quarantine records, a further discriminant model is described without interception data. Though with less accuracy (65%) than the full model, it still correctly predicted the success or failure of four species not used in the previous analysis. Techniques for improving the prediction accuracy are discussed. Predicting which species will establish in a new area appears an achievable goal, which will be a valuable tool for conservation biology."

Data from a survey encompassing areas subjected to different human influences (i.e. from urbanized to protected areas) were fitted by means of generalized linear mixed models, including descriptors of habitats and communities. The incidence of occurrence of C. racemosa was greater on urban than extra-urban or protected reefs, along the coast of Tuscany and NW Sardinia, respectively. Within the Marine Protected Area of Capraia Island (Tuscan Archipelago), the probability of detecting C. racemosa did not vary according to the degree of protection (partial versus total). Human influence was, however, a poor predictor of the seaweed cover. At the seascape level, C. racemosa was more widely spread within degraded (i.e. Posidonia oceanica dead matte or algal turfs) than in better preserved habitats (i.e. canopy-forming macroalgae or P. oceanica seagrass meadows). At a smaller spatial scale, the presence of the seaweed was positively correlated to the diversity of macroalgae and negatively to that of sessile invertebrates. These results suggest that C. racemosa can take advantage of habitat degradation. Thus, predicting invasion scenarios requires a thorough knowledge of ecosystem structure, at a hierarchy of levels of biological organization (from the landscape to the assemblage) and detailed information on the nature and intensity of sources of disturbance and spatial scales at which they operate."

Successful species were subject to more release events, had higher climate matches between their overseas geographic range and their country of introduction, had larger overseas geographic range sizes and were more likely to have established an exotic population elsewhere than was the case for failed species. Of the mammals introduced to New Zealand, successful species also had larger areas of suitable habitat than did failed species.

The common wasp (Vespula vulgaris) is a widespread invader. We sought to determine the Eurasian origin of this wasp and examined world-wide populations for microsporidian pathogen infections to investigate enemy release. Location Argentina, Eurasia, New Zealand. Methods A haplotype network and phylogenetic tree were constructed from combined wasp COI and cytb mitochondrial markers. A morphometric study using canonical discriminant analysis was conducted on wing venation patterns. Microsporidian pathogens prevalence was also examined using small subunit rRNA microsporidia-specific primers. Results Our spatially structured haplotype network from the native range suggested a longitudinal cline of wasp haplotypes along an east to west gradient. Six haplotypes were detected from New Zealand, and two from Argentina. The populations from the introduced range were genetically similar to the western European, United Kingdom and Ireland. The morphometric analysis showed significant morphological variation between countries and supported the Western European origin for New Zealand populations, although not for Argentine samples. Microsporidian infection rates were highest in New Zealand samples (54%), but no significant differences in infection rates were observed between the invaded and native range. Nosema species included matches to N. apis (a pathogen from honey bees) and N. bombi (from bumble bees). Main conclusions Multiple introductions of the common wasp have occurred in the invaded range. A high microsporidian infection rate within the native range, combined with multiple introductions and a reservoir of pathogens in other social insects such as bees, likely contributes to the high microsporidian infection rates in the invaded range. Enemy release is likely to be more frequent when pathogens are rare in the home range, or are host specific and rare in reservoir populations of the introduced range."

While quagga mussel shell morphology differs between shallow and deep habitats, functional causes and consequences of such difference are unknown. We examined whether quagga mussel shell morphology could be induced by three environmental variables through developmental plasticity. We predicted that shallow-water conditions (high temperature, food quantity, water motion) would yield a morphotype typical of wild quagga mussels from shallow habitats, while deep-water conditions (low temperature, food quantity, water motion) would yield a morphotype present in deep habitats. We tested this prediction by examining shell morphology and growth rate of quagga mussels collected from shallow and deep habitats and reared under common-garden treatments that manipulated the three variables. Shell morphology was quantified using the polar moment of inertia. Of the variables tested, temperature had the greatest effect on shell morphology. Higher temperature (similar to 18-20 degrees C) yielded a morphotype typical of wild shallow mussels regardless of the levels of food quantity or water motion. In contrast, lower temperature (similar to 6-8 degrees C) yielded a morphotype approaching that of wild deep mussels. If shell morphology has functional consequences in particular habitats, a plastic response might confer quagga mussels with a greater ability than zebra mussels to colonize a wider range of habitats within the Great Lakes."

In 2001, the American mink (Mustela vison) was recorded for the first time on Navarino Island, in the Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve (55 S) in Chile, representing the southernmost population of mink worldwide. In order to assess its potential impact on native fauna, we studied its diet on Navarino Island, as part of an integrative management program on invasive species. Over a three-year period (2005-2007) we collected 512 scats in semi-aquatic habitats: marine coasts,riparian and lake shores. Overall, the main prey was mammals (37 % biomass), and birds (36 %), followed by fish (24 %). Over the spring and summer, mink consumed significantly more birds, whereas mammals constituted the main prey over the autumn and winter when migratory birds had left the area. Among birds, the mink preyed mainly on adult Passeriformes, followed by Anseriformes and Pelecaniformes, caught as chicks. Among mammals, the exotic muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus) was the most important prey, and together with the native rodent Abrothrix xanthorhinus it accounted for 78 % of the biomass intake. For an integratedmanagement of invasive exotic mammal species on Navarino Island and in the Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve it is important to further research interactions established here among the various introduced mammals, and toinitiate immediate control of the mink population in its initial stage of invasion."

Phenotypic plasticity is often cited as an important mechanism of plant invasion. However, few studies have evaluated the plasticity of a diverse set of traits among invasive and native species, particularly in low resource habitats, and none have examined the functional significance of these traits. 2. I explored trait plasticity in response to variation in light and nutrient availability in five phylogenetically related pairs of native and invasive species occurring in a nutrient-poor habitat. In addition to the magnitude of trait plasticity, I assessed the correlation between 16 leaf- and plant-level traits and plant performance, as measured by total plant biomass. Because plasticity for morphological and physiological traits is thought to be limited in low resource environments (where native species usually display traits associated with resource conservation), I predicted that native and invasive species would display similar, low levels of trait plasticity. 3. Across treatments, invasive and native species within pairs differed with respect to many of the traits measured; however, invasive species as a group did not show consistent patterns in the direction of trait values. Relative to native species, invasive species displayed high plasticity in traits pertaining to biomass partitioning and leaf-level nitrogen and light use, but only in response to nutrient availability. Invasive and native species showed similar levels of resource-use efficiency and there was no relationship between species plasticity and resource-use efficiency across species. 4. Traits associated with carbon fixation were strongly correlated with performance in invasive species while only a single resource conservation trait was strongly correlated with performance in multiple native species. Several highly plastic traits were not strongly correlated with performance which underscores the difficulty in assessing the functional significance of resource conservation traits over short timescales and calls into question the relevance of simple, quantitative assessments of trait plasticity. 5. Synthesis. My data support the idea that invasive species display high trait plasticity. The degree of plasticity observed here for species occurring in low resource systems corresponds with values observed in high resource systems, which contradicts the general paradigm that trait plasticity is constrained in low resource systems. Several traits were positively correlated with plant performance suggesting that trait plasticity will influence plant fitness."

However, these species can interact positively with local communities, increasing their richness, or the abundance of some species. Many invasive species are capable of influencing the habitat itself, by ameliorating physical stress and facilitating the colonization and survival of other organisms. Barnacles are common engineer species that can change the physical structure of the environment, its complexity, and heterogeneity through their own structure. Balanus glandula is a native barnacle of the rocky shores of the west coast of North America. In Argentina, this invasive species not only colonizes rocky shores but it also has successfully colonized soft-bottom salt marshes, where hard substrata are a limiting resource. In these environments, barnacles form three-dimensional structures that increase the structural complexity of the invaded salt marshes. In this work, we compared the composition, density, richness, and diversity of the macroinvertebrate assemblages associated with habitats of different structural complexity in two Patagonian salt marshes where B. glandula is well established. Our results showed differences in the relative distribution and abundances of the invertebrate species between habitats of different complexities. Furthermore, the response of the communities to the changes in the structural complexity generated by B. glandula was different in the two marshes studied. This highlights the fact that B. glandula facilitates other invertebrates and affect community structure, mainly where the settlement substrata (Spartina vs. mussels) are not functionally similar to the barnacle. Thus, our work shows that the rocky shore B. glandula is currently a critical structuring component of the native invertebrate community of soft-bottom environments where this species was introduced along the coast of southern South America."

We found that P. serotina invested a significant amount of energy in height growth and seed production on well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. These characteristics enabled it to rapidly capture canopy gaps and subsequently exert a mass effect on neighbouring stands. On moist soils, we found irregular growth patterns and high rates of fungal attack, while on calcareous soils, leaf traits suggested a low nitrogen assimilation rate, limiting the production of N-containing compounds. We conclude that P. serotina fails on waterlogged and calcareous soils because it is unable to allocate sufficient energy to fruiting and/or height growth. Conversely, it succeeds on well-drained, nutrient-poor soils because of high fitness which increases its invasiveness."

We conducted laboratory and field experiments to examine differential resistance to copper (Cu) between two source populations of the introduced bryozoan Bugula neritina, originating from a polluted (Port Kembla Harbour, NSW, Australia) and an unpolluted (Botany Bay, NSW, Australia) environment. A laboratory toxicity test was conducted to test the relative resistance of B. neritina recruits from the two sources, by measuring the attachment success, survival and growth of individuals exposed to a range of Cu concentrations (0, 25, 50 and 100 mu g l(-1) Cu). Upon completion, reciprocal transplantation of the colonies to the original polluted and unpolluted locations was carried out to assess ongoing survival and growth of colonies in the field. B. neritina colonies originating from the polluted Port Kembla Harbour had increased resistance to Cu relative to populations from an unpolluted part of Botany Bay. There appeared to be a cost associated with increased metal tolerance. In the laboratory, Botany Bay recruits displayed significantly higher growth in control treatments and significantly poorer growth at 100 mu g l(-1) Cu with respect to Port Kembla Harbour individuals, which showed unusually uniform and low growth irrespective of Cu concentration. No difference in attachment success or post-metamorphic survival was observed between populations. Field transplantation showed copper resistance in Port Kembla Harbour colonies constituted an advantage in polluted but not benign environments. The findings of this study provide evidence of the benefits to invasive species of pollution tolerance and suggest that human disturbance can facilitate the establishment and spread of invasive species in marine systems."

Efforts to explain and predict invasion outcomes have been limited primarily to terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems. Invasions are also common in coastal marine ecosystems, yet to date predictive marine invasion models are absent. Here we present a model based on biological attributes associated with invasion success (establishment) of marine molluscs that compares successful and failed invasions from a group of 93 species introduced to San Francisco Bay (SFB) in association with commercial oyster transfers from eastern North America (ca. 1869 to 1940).

Moreover, no previous study has separated the direct effect of alien plants on multiple ecosystem functions simultaneously (multifunctionality) from those indirect ones mediated by the decrease on biodiversity caused by alien plants. We aimed to analyze direct and indirect effects, mediated or not by its effect on biodiversity, of the invasive tree Ailanthus altissima on ecosystem multifunctionality of riparian habitats under Mediterranean climate. We measured vegetation attributes (species richness and phylodiversity) and several surrogates of ecosystem functioning (understory plant biomass, soil enzyme activities, available phosphorous and organic matter) in plots infested by A. altissima and in control (non-invaded) ones. We used structural equation modelling to tease apart the direct and indirect effects of A. altissima on ecosystem multifunctionality. Our results suggest that lower plant species richness, phylodiversity and multifunctionality were associated to the presence of A. altissima. When analyzing each function separately, we found that biodiversity has the opposite effect of the alien plant on all the different functionsmeasured, therefore reducing the strength of the effect (either positive or negative) of A. altissima on them."

In particular, hyper-fecundity and long range dispersal are regarded as invasive traits, but direct comparisons with native species are needed to identify the life-history stages behind invasiveness. Until recently, this task was particularly problematic in forests as tree fecundity and dispersal were difficult to characterize in closed stands. We used inverse modelling to parameterize fecundity, seed dispersal and seedling dispersion functions for two exotic and eight native tree species in closed-canopy forests in Connecticut, USA. Interannual variation in seed production was dramatic for all species, with complete seed crop failures in at least one year for six native species. However, the average per capita seed production of the exotic Ailanthus altissima was extraordinary: > 40 times higher than the next highest species. Seed production of the shade tolerant exotic Acer platanoides was average, but much higher than the native shade tolerant species, and the density of its established seedlings (>= 3 years) was higher than any other species. Overall, the data supported a model in which adults of native and exotic species must reach a minimum size before seed production occurred. Once reached, the relationship between tree diameter and seed production was fairly flat for seven species, including both exotics. Seed dispersal was highly localized and usually showed a steep decline with increasing distance from parent trees: only Ailanthus altissima and Fraxinus americana had mean dispersal distances > 10 m. Janzen-Connell patterns were clearly evident for both native and exotic species, as the mode and mean dispersion distance of seedlings were further from potential parent trees than seeds. The comparable intensity of Janzen-Connell effects between native and exotic species suggests that the enemy escape hypothesis alone cannot explain the invasiveness of these exotics. Our study confirms the general importance of colonization processes in invasions, yet demonstrates how invasiveness can occur via divergent colonization strategies. Dispersal limitation of Acer platanoides and recruitment limitation of Ailanthus altissima will likely constitute some limit on their invasiveness in closed-canopy forests."

A seed-feeding biocontrol agent Bruchidius villosus was released in New Zealand (NZ) to control the invasive European shrub, broom Cytisus scoparius, in 1988 but it was subsequently considered unable to destroy sufficient seed to suppress broom populations. We hypothesized that an invasive mite Varroa destructor, which has caused honeybee decline in NZ, may cause pollinator limitation, so that the additional impact of B. villosus might now reach thresholds for population suppression. 2. We performed manipulative pollination treatments and broad-scale surveys of pollination, seed rain and seed destruction by B. villosus to investigate how pollinator limitation and biocontrol interact throughout the NZ range of broom. 3. The effect of reduced pollination in combination with seed-destruction was explored using a population model parameterized for NZ populations. 4. Broom seed rain ranged from 59 to 21 416 seeds m-2 from 2004 to 2008, and was closely correlated with visitation frequency of honeybees and bumblebees. Infestation of broom seeds by B. villosus is expected to eventually reach 73% (the average rate observed at the localities adjacent to early release sites). 5. The model demonstrated that 73% seed destruction, combined with an absence of honeybee pollination, could cause broom extinction at many sites and, where broom persists, reduce the intensity of treatment required to control broom by conventional means. 6. Nevertheless, seed rain was predicted to be sufficient to maintain broom invasions over many sites in NZ, even in the presence of the varroa mite and B. villosus, largely due to the continued presence of commercial beehives that are treated for varroa mite infestation. 7. Synthesis and applications. Reduced pollination through absence of honeybees can reduce broom seed set to levels at which biocontrol can be more effective. To capitalize on the impact of the varroa mite on feral honeybees, improved management of commercial beehives (for example, withdrawal of licences for beekeepers to locate hives on Department of Conservation land) could be used as part of a successful integrated broom management programme at many sites in NZ."

These services, which include stabilizing the soil surface, can be adversely affected when BSCs are disturbed. Using field and greenhouse experiments, we tested the hypothesis that mechanical disturbance of BSC increases emergence of exotic vascular plants in a coastal CSS ecosystem. At Whiting Ranch Wilderness Park in southern California, 22 plots were established and emergence of exotic and native plants was compared between disturbed and undisturbed subplots containing BSC. In a separate germination study, seed fate in disturbed BSC cores was compared to seed fate in undisturbed BSC cores for three exotic and three native species. In the field, disturbed BSCs had significantly (>3x) greater exotic plant emergence than in undisturbed BSC, particularly for annual grasses. Native species, however, showed no difference in emergence between disturbed and undisturbed BSC. Within the disturbed treatment, emergence of native plants was significantly, and three times less than that of exotic plants. In the germination study, seed fates for all species were significantly different between disturbed and undisturbed BSC cores. Exotic species had greater emergence in disturbed BSC, whereas native plants showed either no response or a positive response. This study demonstrates another critical ecosystem service of BSCs-the inhibition of exotic plant species-and underscores the importance of BSC conservation in this biodiversity hotspot and possibly in other aridland ecosystems."

While P. australis has historically been restricted to the relatively benign upper border of brackish and salt marshes, it has been expanding seaward into more physiologically stressful regions. Here we test a leading hypothesis that the spread of P. australis is due to anthropogenic modification of coastal marshes. We did a field experiment along natural borders between stands of P. australis and the other dominant grasses and rushes (i.e., matrix vegetation) in a brackish marsh in Rhode Island, USA. We applied a pulse disturbance in one year by removing or not removing neighboring matrix vegetation and adding three levels of nutrients (specifically nitrogen) in a factorial design, and then we monitored the aboveground performance of P. australis and the matrix vegetation. Both disturbances increased the density, height, and biomass of shoots of P. australis, and the effects of fertilization were more pronounced where matrix vegetation was removed. Clearing competing matrix vegetation also increased the distance that shoots expanded and their reproductive output, both indicators of the potential for P. australis to spread within and among local marshes. In contrast, the biomass of the. matrix vegetation decreased with increasing severity of disturbance. Disturbance increased the total aboveground production of plants in the marsh as matrix vegetation was displaced by P. australis. A greenhouse experiment showed that, with increasing nutrient levels, P. australis allocates proportionally more of its biomass to aboveground structures used for spread than to belowground structures used for nutrient acquisition. Therefore, disturbances that enrich nutrients or remove competitors promote the spread of P. australis by reducing belowground competition for nutrients between P. australis and the matrix vegetation, thus allowing P. australis, the largest plant in the marsh, to expand and displace the matrix vegetation. Reducing nutrient load and maintaining buffers of matrix vegetation along the terrestrial-marsh ecotone will, therefore, be important methods of control for this nuisance species."

In contrast, the biotic resistance hypothesis states that many invaders are prevented from establishing because of competitive interactions, including herbivory, with native fauna and flora. Success or failure of spread and establishment might also be influenced by the presence or absence of mutualists, such as pollinators. Senecio madagascariensis (fireweed), an annual weed from South Africa, inhabits a similar range in Australia to the related native S. pinnatifolius. The aim of this study was to determine, within the context of invasion biology theory, whether the two Senecio species share insect fauna, including floral visitors and herbivores. Surveys were carried out in south-east Queensland on allopatric populations of the two Senecio species, with collected insects identified to morphospecies. Floral visitor assemblages were variable between populations. However, the two Senecio species shared the two most abundant floral visitors, honeybees and hoverflies. Herbivore assemblages, comprising mainly hemipterans of the families Cicadellidae and Miridae, were variable between sites and no patterns could be detected between Senecio species at the morphospecies level. However, when insect assemblages were pooled (i.e. community level analysis), S. pinnatifolius was shown to host a greater total abundance and richness of herbivores. Senecio madagascariensis is unlikely to be constrained by lack of pollinators in its new range and may benefit from lower levels of herbivory compared to its native congener S. pinnatifolius."

Contrary to many other reports, we found no differences in the herbivore load between native and alien hosts. The majority of insect species attacked alien as well as native hosts. Across insect species, there was no difference in the patterns of host range on native and on alien hosts. Likewise the similarity of insect communities across pairs of host species was not different between natives and aliens. We conclude that the general similarity in the community patterns between native and alien cabbage plant species are due to the chemical characteristics of this plant family. All cabbage plants share glucosinolates. This may facilitate host switches from natives to aliens. Hence the presence of native congeners may influence invasiveness of alien plants."

This paper addresses how native aquatic macrophyte communities are affected by the non-native species Urochloa arrecta, a current successful invader in Brazilian freshwater systems. We compared the native macrophytes colonizing patches dominated and non-dominated by this invader species. We surveyed eight streams in Northwest Parana State (Brazil). In each stream, we recorded native macrophytes' richness and biomass in sites where U. arrecta was dominant and in sites where it was not dominant or absent. No native species were found in seven, out of the eight investigated sites where U. arrecta was dominant. Thus, we found higher native species richness, Shannon index and native biomass values in sites without dominance of U. arrecta than in sites dominated by this invader. Although difficult to conclude about causes of such differences, we infer that the elevated biomass production by this grass might be the primary reason for alterations in invaded environments and for the consequent impacts on macrophytes' native communities. However, biotic resistance offered by native richer sites could be an alternative explanation for our results. To mitigate potential impacts and to prevent future environmental perturbations, we propose mechanical removal of the invasive species and maintenance or restoration of riparian vegetation, for freshwater ecosystems have vital importance for the maintenance of ecological services and biodiversity and should be preserved."

When immigration is enhanced by high propagule pressure or low-intensity disturbance, the relationship between diversity and exotic species invasion should be positive. Only when such immigration processes are limited should competitive interactions lead to a negative correlation between diversity and invasibility. Moreover, competition should be more apparent at smaller scales where individual plants compete directly for space; thus, diversity and invasibility are more likely to be negatively correlated at small spatial scales. We tested these predictions by comparing exotic and native species diversity of vascular plants across five spatial scales in riparian and upland plant communities in the southern Appalachians, We found a positive relationship between species diversity and exotic invasion in riparian areas at large scales (100 m(2)). Which graded into a negative relationship at small scales (0.01 m(2)). In uplands, there was a slight positive relationship between native and exotic species diversity at both scales of observation.

Ecological theory predicts, and small-scale experiments confirm, lower levels of nonnative species invasion into species-rich compared to species-poor communities, but observational studies across a wider range of scales often report positive relationships between native and nonnative species richness. This paradox has been attributed to the scale dependency of diversity-invasibility relationships and to differences between experimental and observational studies. Disturbance is widely recognized as an important factor determining invasibility of communities, but few studies have investigated the relative and interactive roles of diversity and disturbance on nonnative species invasion. Here, we report how the relationship between native and nonnative plant species richness responded to an experimentally applied disturbance gradient (from no disturbance up to clearcut) in oak-dominated forests. We consider whether results are consistent with various explanations of diversity-invasibility relationships including biotic resistance, resource availability, and the potential effects of scale (I m 2 to 2 ha). We found no correlation between native and normative species richness before disturbance except at the largest spatial scale, but a positive relationship after disturbance across scales and levels of disturbance. Post-disturbance richness of both native and normative species was positively correlated with disturbance intensity and with variability of residual basal area of trees. These results suggest that more nonnative plants may invade species-rich communities compared to species-poor communities following disturbance."

Pathogens may play an important role in the invasive process, facilitating colonization of their hosts in new continents and islands. According to the Novel Weapon Hypothesis, colonizers may out-compete local native species by bringing with them novel pathogens to which native species are not adapted. In contrast, the Enemy Release Hypothesis suggests that flourishing colonizers are successful because they have left their pathogens behind. To assess the role of avian malaria and related haemosporidian parasites in the global spread of a common invasive bird, we examined the prevalence and genetic diversity of haemosporidian parasites (order Haemosporida, genera Plasmodium and Haemoproteus) infecting house sparrows (Passer domesticus). We sampled house sparrows (N = 1820) from 58 locations on 6 continents. All the samples were tested using PCR-based methods; blood films from the PCR-positive birds were examined microscopically to identify parasite species. The results show that haemosporidian parasites in the house sparrows' native range are replaced by species from local host-generalist parasite fauna in the alien environments of North and South America. Furthermore, sparrows in colonized regions displayed a lower diversity and prevalence of parasite infections. Because the house sparrow lost its native parasites when colonizing the American continents, the release from these natural enemies may have facilitated its invasion in the last two centuries. Our findings therefore reject the Novel Weapon Hypothesis and are concordant with the Enemy Release Hypothesis."

For example, are aliens concentrated in niches under-exploited by native communities, or widely distributed across the ecological spectrum? To explore this question, we compared the niches occupied by 394 naturalized alien plants with a representative sample from the native flora of Mediterranean islands. When niche structure was described by a functional group categorization, the distribution of native and alien species was remarkably similar, although ""succulent shrubs"" and ""trees with specialized animal pollination mechanisms"" were under-represented in the native species pool. When niche structure was described by Grime's CSR strategy, the positioning of aliens and natives differed more strongly. Stress-tolerance was much rarer amongst the aliens, and a competitive strategy was more prevalent at the habitat level. This pattern is similar to previous findings in temperate Europe, although in those regions it closely reflects patterns of native diversity. Stressed environments are much more dominant in the Mediterranean. We discuss a number of factors which may contribute to this difference, e.g., competitive and ruderal niches are often associated with anthropogenic habitats, and their high invasibility may be due partly to introduction patterns rather than to a greater efficiency of aliens at exploiting them. Thus far, the reasons for invasion success amongst introduced species have proved difficult to unravel. Despite some differences, our evidence suggests that alien species naturalize across a wide range of niches. Given that their ecologies therefore vary greatly, one may ask why such species should be expected to share predictable traits at all?"

We investigated the responses of three introduced mammals (red deer, Cervus elaphus; wild boar, Sus scrofa; and European hare, Lepus europaeus) to replacement of native vegetation by exotic pine plantations in the Patagonian forest-steppe ecotone using camera-trap surveys (8633 trap-days). We used logistic regression models to relate species presence with habitat variables at stand and landscape scales. Red deer and wild boar used pine plantations significantly more frequently than native vegetation. In contrast, occurrence of European hares did not differ between pine plantations and native vegetation, although hares were recorded more frequently in firebreaks than in plantations or native vegetation. Presence of red deer and wild boar was positively associated with cover of pine plantations at the landscape scale, and negatively associated with mid-storey cover and diversity at the stand scale. European hares preferred sites with low arboreal and mid-storey cover. Our results suggest that pine plantations promote increased abundances of invasive species whose original distributions are associated with woodlands (red deer and wild boar), and could act as source or pathways for invasive species to new areas."

One possible explanation is that highly successful invaders tend to be functionally similar to, and therefore compete most strongly with, resident species that are also relatively successful and widespread. High abundance may then protect these functionally similar residents from complete extinction over large areas despite their stronger competition with the invader. We tested this idea in a native-rich grassland where a novel invader, Aegilops triuncialis (barb goatgrass), strongly affects community diversity at the local scale. We compared resident species abundances in paired invaded and uninvaded plots with similar soil and community characteristics and invasibility as assayed by experimentally planted Aegilops. We found that the negative effects of the invader on abundance were strongest on resident species belonging to the same functional group as the invader (annual grasses). Within grasses, multivariate functional similarity to the invader also predicted decline in abundance under invasion. However, we did not find the predicted general relationship between abundance, functional similarity to the invader, and tendency to decline under invasion. Additional factors, such as spatial heterogeneity in the invaded community, must contribute to the relative scarcity of large-scale extinctions under invasion."

Moreover, how spatial habitat heterogeneity affects the persistence of interacting invasive and native species is also poorly understood. Here we show how the persistence of a native prey (water vole, Arvicola terrestris) is determined by the spatial distribution of an invasive prey (European rabbit, Oryctolagus cuniculus) and directly infer how this is defined by the mobility of a shared invasive predator (American mink, Neovison vison). This study uniquely demonstrates that variation in habitat connectivity in large-scale natural landscapes creates spatial asynchrony, enabling coexistence between apparent competitive native and invasive species. These findings highlight that unexpected interactions may be involved in species declines, and also that in such cases habitat heterogeneity should be considered in wildlife management decisions."

We compared the response of a rapidly invading forb (Hieracium pilosella L.) between different experimental treatments in a short tussock grassland in New Zealand, over 6-12 years, to determine whether the theory explains differences in invasibility. The theory predicts that environments subject to periodic resource enrichment will be more invasible than those with more stable resource-supply rates. In our study, H. pilosella did not increase more rapidly in treatments subject to periodic resource pulses (fertiliser and water) than in those with more stable resource supplies. Also contrary to the predictions of the theory, the rate of invasion of H. pilosella did not increase following an increase in the rate of supply of water or nutrient resources, or following treatments that temporarily reduced resource uptake in the community, including grazing. H. pilosella did not increase immediately following abrupt increases in water and nutrient supply and removal of the dominant grass species with herbicide, as predicted by the theory, although temporary increases in resident exotic guilds indicated that the intensity of competition for resources was reduced. Neither H. pilosella nor resident exotic guilds showed increased cover growth rates following resumed grazing. The rate of invasion by H. pilosella was not correlated with species richness, a result consistent with one of the predictions of the theory. Therefore, short-lived events that temporarily reduced or suspended competition did not appear to determine the invasion success of this particular species in this region. In New Zealands perennial short tussock grasslands, the characteristics of the resident plant community may be more critical than resource fluctuations in determining invasion success of H. pilosella. Invasion of H. pilosella may be most successfully controlled here by promoting a successional physiognomic shift to a taller, shrub-and-tussock-dominated canopy that competitively excludes low-growing forbs."

To address this problem, we focus on the conditional mutualism between S. invicta and P. solenopsis by field investigations and indoor experiments. In the laboratory, ant colony growth increased significantly when ants had access to P. solenopsis and animal-based food. Honeydew produced by P. solenopsis also improved the survival of ant workers. In the field, colony density of P. solenopsis was significantly greater on plots with ants than on plots without ants. The number of mealybug mummies on plants without fire ants was almost three times that of plants with fire ants, indicating a strong effect of fire ants on mealybug survival. In addition, the presence of S. invicta successfully contributed to the spread of P. solenopsis. The quantity of honeydew consumption by S. invicta was significantly greater than that of a presumptive native ant, Tapinoma melanocephalum. When compared with the case without ant tending, mealybugs tended by ants matured earlier and their lifespan and reproduction increased. T. melanocephalum workers arrived at honeydew more quickly than S. invicta workers, while the number of foraging S. invicta workers on plants steadily increased, eventually exceeding that number of T. melanocephalum foragers. Overall, these results suggest that the conditional mutualism between S. invicta and P. solenopsis facilitates population growth and fitness of both species. S. invicta tends to acquire much more honeydew and drive away native ants, promoting their predominance. These results suggest that the higher foraging tempo of S. invicta may provide more effective protection of P. solenopsis than native ants.

It predicts that exotic genera with native representatives should be less successful because of an overlap in resource use and of the existence of common specialised enemies. In this study, we tested whether native congenerics have more negative impact on exotic species than heterogenerics by increasing the effects of soil pathogens. We sampled soil in populations of three exotic species (Epilobium ciliatum, Impatiens parviflora and Stenactis annua) at sites with and without respective congeneric species. This soil was used as an inoculum for cultivating the first plant cohort, which included exotics, as well as native congenerics and heterogenerics. The conditioned soil was subsequently used for cultivating the second cohort of plants (exotics only). We found no consistent impact of relatedness of conditioning species on exotic growth. Although soil conditioned by congeneric E. hirsutum had the largest reduction on the performance of E. ciliatum, the final biomass of S. annua was lowest when grown in soil conditioned by itself. There was no effect of stimulating species on the biomass of I. parviflora. In both experimental phases, performance of exotics was improved when cultivated with sterilised inoculua, indicating the dominance of soil generalist pathogens. However, the biomass of S. annua was increased most by congeneric-stimulated inoculum from congeneric sites, suggesting a possible role for specialised symbionts. Our results suggest that variations in invasion success of at least some exotics may be affected by species-specific interactions mediated by the soil biota.

Br., a climbing fern native to the Pantropics of the Old World, is aggressively colonizing natural ecosystems in the Florida Peninsula. Here, we examined soil factors that might affect the fern's invasiveness, specifically addressing the hypothesis that a release from natural belowground enemies contributes to its vigorous growth in Florida. We also investigated phenotypic differences of sporophytes raised from spores collected in Florida and the fern's native range in Australia, hypothesizing that the Florida population would possess traits resulting in faster growth and superior competitive ability than the two Australian populations. We tested our hypotheses in parallel greenhouse experiments—one in Australia using soil from the fern's native habitat, and another in Florida, USA, with soil from a recently colonized ecosystem. Fern growth rate and its principal determinants were expressed relative to the optimal growth with a common sand culture in each experiment and compared among treatments in which soil was altered through either sterilization or nutrient amendment, or both. Contrary to the expectation, the optimal growth rates in the sand culture were higher for Australian populations than the Florida population, while the comparatively poor growth of all populations in unaltered soil was stimulated by nutrient amendment and sterilization. The overall effect of sterilization, however, was muted under high-nutrient conditions, suggesting that the effect of soil sterilization may be due to greater nutrient availability in sterilized soils. The only exception was the local population from the site where the soil was collected for the experiment in Australia, which grew significantly faster in sterilized than in non-sterilized soil, and also more rapidly in response to soil insecticide application. Our results indicate that the invasiveness of L. microphyllum in Florida is not a simple phenotypic difference in inherent growth rate as predicted by the evolution of increased competitive ability hypothesis, but it may be mediated in part by release from soil-borne enemies that vary in their effectiveness even within the native geographical range of the fern.

Interactions between nonnative species may alter their impacts on native species, yet few studies have addressed multispecies interactions. The spread of whirling disease, caused by the nonnative parasite Myxobolus cerebralis, has generated declines in wild trout populations across western North America. Westslope Cutthroat Trout Oncorhynchus clarkii lewisi in the northern Rocky Mountains are threatened by hybridization with introduced Rainbow Trout O. mykiss. Rainbow Trout are more susceptible to whirling disease than Cutthroat Trout and may be more vulnerable due to differences in spawning location. We hypothesized that the presence of whirling disease in a stream would (1) reduce levels of introgressive hybridization at the site scale and (2) limit the size of the hybrid zone at the whole-stream scale. We measured levels of introgression and the spatial extent of hybridization between Rainbow Trout and Westslope Cutthroat Trout in four disease-positive streams and six disease-negative streams within the Blackfoot River basin of Montana. In addition to disease status, we considered habitat quality, stream slope, distance from the confluence, temperature, and elevation. Whirling disease presence was not associated with either the level of introgression at a site or the size of the hybrid zone. Temperature, elevation, and stream slope were all influential in determining levels of introgression at the site scale. Stream slope was the most influential factor determining the size of the hybrid zone, as longer, steeper streams contained smaller hybrid zones. Stream slope is a driver of many habitat characteristics that may provide refuge from invasive species in the coming decades. Although the multispecies interactions examined in this study did not alter the impacts of invasion on native species, community assemblages will continue to change with the spread of nonnative species, requiring continued assessment to determine their impacts on native species."

Community characteristics that most strongly influence invasion are uncertain, however, due to covariation of diversity with competition and crowding. We examined separately the effects of species richness and dominance on invasion by an exotic legume, Melilotus officinalis, in intact, native Kansas grassland. We manipulated dominance of C4 grasses by reducing their abundance (i.e. ramet densities) by ~25 and 50%. In addition, richness was reduced by removing species that were mainly rare and uncommon as might be expected with environmental changes such as drought and fragmentation. In both years of the study (2001-2002), invasibility, measured as peak establishment of Melilotus, was not affected by a 3-fold reduction in species richness, nor was there an interaction between loss of species and reduced dominance on invasion. In contrast, reductions in abundance of the dominants significantly reduced invasibility of the grassland plots in both years. Because the abundance of dominants was highly correlated with measures of competition (i.e. ratio of dominant biomass to total biomass) and crowding (total stem densities), this pattern was opposite to that expected if competition were indeed limiting invasion. Rather, invasion appeared to be facilitated by the dominant species, most likely because reduced dominance increased environmental stress. Our results suggest that dominance is the key community characteristic determining invasibility, because highly competitive and space-filling species can either enhance or reduce susceptibility to invasion depending on whether dominants create a more competitive environment or alleviate stressful conditions."

Although the number of species can affect community invasibility, other aspects of diversity, including species identity and community evenness, may be equally important. While several field studies have examined how invasibility varies with diversity by manipulating species identity or evenness, the results are often confounded by resource heterogeneity, site history, or disturbance. We designed a mesocosm experiment to examine explicitly the role of dominant species identity and evenness on the invasibility of grassland plant communities. We found that the identity of the dominant plant species, but not community evenness, significantly impacted invasibility. Using path analysis, we found that community composition (dominant species identity) reduced invasion by reducing early-season light availability and increasing late-season plant community biomass. Nitrogen availability was an important factor for the survival of invaders in the second year of the experiment. We also found significant direct effects of certain dominant species on invasion, although the mechanisms driving these effects remain unclear. The magnitude of dominant species effects on invasibility we observed are comparable to species richness effects observed in other studies, showing that species composition and dominant species can have strong effects on the invasibility of a community."

Based on these observations of dominance, invaders are often described as competitively superior, despite little direct evidence of competitive interactions with natives. The few studies that have measured competitive interactions have tended to compare an invader to natives that are unlikely to be strong competitors because they are functionally different. In this study, we measured competitive interactions among an invasive grass and two Australian native grasses that are functionally similar and widely distributed. We conducted a pair-wise glasshouse experiment, where we manipulated both biotic factors (timing of establishment, neighbour identity and density) and abiotic factors (nutrients and timing of water supply). We found that the invader significantly suppressed the performance of the natives; but its suppression ability was contingent on resource levels, with pulsed water/low nutrients or continuous watering reducing its competitive effects. The native grasses were able to suppress the performance of the invader when given a 3-week head-start, suggesting the invader may be incapable of establishing unless it emerges first, including in its own understorey. These findings provide insight for restoration, as the competitive effect of a functionally similar invader may be reduced by altering abiotic and biotic conditions in favour of natives."

The ELS of native fish were only rarely infected by native glochidia. By contrast, exotic fish displayed significantly higher native glochidia prevalence and mean intensity of infection than native fish (17 versus 2% and 3.3 versus 1.4 respectively), inferring potential for a parasite spillback/dilution effect. Exotic fish also displayed a higher parasitic load for exotic glochidia, inferring potential for invasional meltdown. Compared to native fish, presence of gobiids increased the total number of glochidia transported downstream on drifting fish by approximately 900%. We show that gobiid ELS are a novel, numerous and attractive' resource for unionid glochidia. As such, unionids could negatively affect gobiid recruitment through infection-related mortality of gobiid ELS and/or reinforce downstream unionid populations through transport on drifting gobiid ELS. These implications go beyond what is suggested in studies of older life stages, thereby stressing the importance of an holistic ontogenetic approach in ecological studies."

Structure, floristic composition and invasibility of the plant communities and attributes of the invasive species were studied. To determine the plant characteristics correlated with invasiveness, we distinguished between roadside invaders, native community invaders and non-invasive exotic species, and compared these groups across a range of traits including functional group, taxonomic affinity, life history, mating system and morphology. Poa grasslands and Eucalyptus-Poa woodlands contained the largest number of exotic species, although all communities studied appeared resilient to invasion by most species. Most community invaders were broad-leaved herbs while roadside invaders contained both herbs and a range of grass species. Over the entire study area the richness and cover of native and exotic herbaceous species were positively related, but exotic herbs were more negatively related to cover of specific functional groups (e.g. trees) than native herbs. Compared with the overall pool of exotic species, those capable of invading native plant communities were disproportionately polycarpic, Asteracean and cross-pollinating. Our data support the hypothesis that strong ecological filtering of exotic species generates an exotic assemblage containing few dominant species and which functionally converges on the native assemblage. These findings contrast with those observed in the majority of invaded natural systems. We conclude that the invasion of closed sub-alpine communities must be viewed in terms of the unique attributes of the invading species, the structure and composition of the invaded communities and the strong extrinsic physical and climatic factors typical of the sub-alpine environment."

Acer negundo, a North American tree, has widely invaded riparian forests throughout Europe at the ecotone between early- (Salix spp. and Populus spp.) and late-successional (Fraxinus spp.) species. However, it is not present in the upper part of the Rhone River, where native Alnus incana occurs at an intermediate position along the successional riparian gradient. Is this absence of the invasive tree due to environmental or biotic resistance of the recipient communities, and in particular due to the presence of Alnus? Location Upper Rhone River, France. Methods We undertook a transplant experiment in an Alnus-dominated community along the Upper Rhone River, where we compared Acer negundo survival and growth, with and without biotic interactions (tree and herb layer effects), to those of four native tree species from differing successional positions in the Upper Rhone communities (P. alba, S. alba, F. excelsior and Alnus incana). Results Without biotic interactions Acer negundo performed similarly to native species, suggesting that the Upper Rhone floodplain is not protected from Acer invasion by a simple abiotic barrier. In contrast, this species performed less well than F. excelsior and Alnus incana in environments with intact tree and/or herb layers. Alnus showed the best growth rate in these conditions, indicating biotic resistance of the native plant community. Conclusions We did not find evidence for an abiotic barrier to Acer negundo invasion of the Upper Rhone River floodplain communities, but our results suggest a biotic resistance. In particular, we demonstrated that (i) additive competitive effects of the tree and herb layer led to Acer negundo suppression and (ii) Alnus incana grew more rapidly than Acer negundo in this intermediate successional niche."

D. villosus geographic extension and quickly increasing population density has enabled it to become a major component of macrobenthic assemblages in recipient ecosystems. The ecological characteristics of D. villosus on a mesohabitat scale were investigated at a station in the Moselle River. This amphipod is able to colonize a wide range of substratum types, thus posing a threat to all freshwater ecosystems. Rivers whose dominant substratum is cobbles and which have tree roots along the banks could harbour particularly high densities of D. villosus. A relationship exists between substratum particle size and the length of the individuals, and spatial segregation according to length was shown. This allows the species to limit intra-specific competition between generations while facilitating reproduction. A strong association exists between D. villosus and other Ponto-Caspian species, such as Dreissena polymorpha and Corophium curvispinum, in keeping with Invasional Meltdown Theory. Four taxa (Coenagrionidae, Calopteryx splendens, Corophium curvispinum and Gammarus pulex) exhibited spatial niches that overlap significantly that of D. villosus. According to the predatory behaviour of the newcomer, their populations may be severely impacted."

Here, we describe a temporal snapshot of the diet and feeding preferences of possums in a dryland habitat in New Zealand's South Island, as well as movement patterns and survival rates. We also briefly explore spatial patterns in capture rates. We trapped 279 possums at an average capture rate of 9 possums per 100 trap nights. Capture rates on individual trap lines varied from 0 to 38%, decreased with altitude, and were highest in the eastern (drier) parts of the study area. Stomach contents were dominated by forbs and sweet briar (Rosa rubiginosa); both items were consumed preferentially relative to availability. Possums also strongly preferred crack willow (Salix fragilis), which was uncommon in the study area and consumed only occasionally, but in large amounts. Estimated activity areas of 29 possums radio-tracked for up to 12 months varied from 0.2 to 19.5 ha (mean 5.1 ha). Nine possums (4 male, 5 female) undertook dispersal movements (>=1000 m), the longest of which was 4940 m. The most common dens of radio-collared possums were sweet briar shrubs, followed by rock outcrops. Estimated annual survival was 85% for adults and 54% for subadults. Differences between the diets, activity areas and den use of possums in this study and those in forest or farmland most likely reflect differences in availability and distribution of resources. Our results suggest that invasive willow and sweet briar may facilitate the existence of possums by providing abundant food and shelter. In turn, possums may facilitate the spread of weeds by acting as a seed vector. This basic ecological information will be useful in modelling and managing the impacts of possum populations in drylands."

In the last twenty years the spread of fountain grass in the Canary Islands has been very rapid. We compared its ecophysiological, architectural and reproductive traits with those of three native grasses (Hyparrhenia hirta, Cenchrus ciliaris and Aristida adscensionis) in two habitats of Tenerife Island which differ in rainfall. The detection of traits that differ between native and invader grasses may provide information for the improved control and eradication of the latter contributing to protect the native plant diversity. P. setaceum and the native grasses differed in all measured traits and in their response to water availability which is more restricted in the southern site. Specific leaf area was lower in P. setaceum than in the native grasses. Although this reduces carbon assimilation per unit area, it also reduces transpiration, increasing water use efficiency and contributes to the maintenance of high relative water content. Leaf N in P. setaceum was lower than in the native grasses indicating higher nitrogen use efficiency. The activity of photosystem II was higher and lasted longer in P. setaceum than in the native grasses. The ecophysiological traits of P. setaceum support its large size, extensive canopy and shorter leaf senescence period. They confer considerable competitive advantage to the invader and partially explain its success in the Canary Islands. The differences between the invader and the native grasses were maintained in both sites revealing a good adaptation of P. setaceum to the low resource local habitats in the Canary Islands and confirms its large plasticity. The large invasive potential of P. setaceum, in concert with the projected global changes, forecast eventual risks for the conservation of the endemic flora and remaining native communities in the Canary Islands.

The microbial inocula were from a constructed community of plant rhizosphere-associated bacteria and a complexity gradient of communities derived from industrial wastewater treatment plant-activated sludge. Community stability and community function were defined as the ability of the community to resist invasion by a competitor (Pseudomonas fluorescens 5RL) and the ability to degrade surfactant, respectively. Carbon source utilization was evaluated by measuring surfactant degradation and through Biolog and BD oxygen biosensor community level physiological profiling. Community profiles were obtained from a 16S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer region array. A wastewater treatment plant-derived community with the greatest species richness was the least susceptible to invasion and was able to degrade surfactant to a greater extent than the other complexity gradient communities. All communities resisted invasion by a competitor to a greater extent than the plant rhizosphere isolate constructed community. However, the constructed community degraded surfactant to a greater extent than any of the other communities and utilized the same number of carbon sources as many of the other communities. These results demonstrate that community function (carbon source utilization) and community stability (resistance to invasion) are a function of the structural composition of the community irrespective of species richness or functional richness."

Oil well drilling, the major anthropogenic disturbance over the past 21 years in the area, was used as an indirect measure of propagule pressure. An analysis of 82 potential introductions at oil production platforms revealed that the probability of successful establishment significantly increased with the number of drilling events. Specifically, the shape of the dose-response establishment curve could be closely approximated by a Poisson process with a 34% chance of infestation per well drilled. Consistent with our knowledge of largely clonal reproduction by W. auropunctata, the shape of the establishment curve suggested that the ants were not substantially affected by Allee effects, probably greatly contributing to this species' success as an invader. By contrast, the extent to which W. auropunctata spread beyond the point of initial introduction, and thus the extent of its damage to diversity of other ant species, was independent of propagule pressure. These results suggest that while establishment success depends on propagule pressure, other ecological or genetic factors may limit the extent of further spread. Knowledge of the shape of the dose-response establishment curve should prove useful in modelling the future spread of W. auropunctata and perhaps the spread of other clonal organisms."

We used gammarids differing in their origin and level of association with mussels: Ponto-Caspian aliens Dikerogammarus villosus (commonly occurring in mussel beds) and Pontogammarus robustoides (not associated with mussels), as well as native European Gammarus fossarum (not co-occurring with dreissenids). The gammarids were exposed to predation of two fish species: the racer goby Babka gymnotrachelus (Ponto-Caspian) and Amur sleeper Perccottus glenii (Eastern Asian). This set of organisms allowed us to check whether the origin and level of association with mussels of both prey and predators affect the ability of gammarids to utilize zebra mussel beds as shelters. We tested gammarid survival in the presence of fish and one of five substrata: sand, macrophytes, stones, living mussels and empty mussel valves. D. villosus survived better than its congeners on all substrata, and its survival was highest in living dreissenids. The survival of the other gammarids was similar on all substrata. Both fish species exhibited similar predation efficiency. Thus, D. villosus, whose affinity to dreissenids has already been established, utilizes them as protection from fish predators, including allopatric predators, more efficiently than other amphipods. Therefore, the presence of dreissenids in areas invaded by D. villosus is likely to help the invader establish itself in a new place."

Natural gradients provide an ideal opportunity to test this hypothesis. 2 In a coastal dune system in northern California, we used comparative and experimental studies to evaluate how a wind and soil texture gradient influences the relative abundance of native and exotic plant species in this community. 3 We detected small-scale spatial variation in soil texture along a 200-m gradient from relatively sheltered to more exposed. Sand coarseness significantly increased with exposure while soil nitrate levels significantly decreased. The more extreme end of the gradient was also subject to greater wind speeds and less soil moisture. 4 The plant community consistently responded to this gradient in the 7 years censused. Species richness decreased with exposure, cover of natives decreased and cover of exotics increased at the more extreme end of the gradient. 5 A single-season wind-shelter experiment similarly shifted the balance between native and exotic species. Shelters decreased the relative density of exotic species and increased the relative density of natives regardless of position on the gradient. 6 These comparative and manipulative findings both suggest that a single factor, wind, at least partially explains the success of exotic species in a coastal dune plant community. This supports the hypothesis that local abiotic conditions can explain differences in invasibility within a plant community."

Here we describe the effects of invasion by Norway maple Acer platanoides on riparian plant communities and tree regeneration at two different scales (individual tree vs stand scales) in western Montana, USA, using both descriptive and experimental approaches. The three stands differed in community composition with the stand most dominated by A. platanoides invasion being more compositionally homogenous, and less species rich (-67%), species even (-40%), and diverse (-75%) than the two other stands. This sharp decrease in community richness and diversity of the highly invaded stand, relative to the other stands, corresponded with a 28-fold increase in A. platanoides seedlings and saplings. The dramatic difference between stand 1 vs 2 and 3 suggests that A. platanoides invasion is associated with a dramatic change in community composition and local loss of species diversity; however, other unaccounted for differences between stands may be the cause. These whole-stand correlations were corroborated by community patterns under individual A. platanoides trees in a stand with intermediate levels of patchy invasion. At the scale of individual A. platanoides canopies within a matrix of native trees, diversity and richness of species beneath solitary A. platanoides trees declined as the size of the trees increased. These decreases in native community properties corresponded with an increase in the density of A. platanoides seedlings. The effect of A. platanoides at the stand scale was more dramatic than at the individual canopy scale; however, at this smaller scale we only collected data from the stand with intermediate levels of invasion and not from the stand with high levels of invasion. Transplant experiments with tree seedlings demonstrated that A. platanoides seedlings performed better when grown beneath conspecific canopies than under natives, but Populus and Pinus seedlings performed better when grown beneath Populus canopies, the dominant native. Our results indicate that A. platanoides trees suppress most native species, including the regeneration of the natural canopy dominants, but facilitate conspecifics in their understories."

The unburned area was sampled in 1998 and the burned area in 1999; 25% of the plots were resampled in 2001 to ensure that differences between sites were consistent and persistent, and not due to inter-annual climatic differences. Species composition differed significantly between unburned and burned sites; eight species were identified as indicators of the unburned site and thirteen as indicators of the burned site. Plant cover was nearly twice as great in the burned site than in the unburned site in the first years of measurement and was 4.6 times greater in the burned site in 2001. Average and total species richness was greater in the burned site, explained mostly by higher numbers of native annual and biennial forbs.

In 1993, a prescribed fire in a dense, never-harvested forest on the North Rim of Grand Canyon National Park escaped prescription and burned with greater intensity and severity than expected. We sampled this burned area and an adjacent unburned area to assess fire effects on understory species composition, diversity, and plant cover. The unburned area was sampled in 1998 and the burned area in 1999; 25% of the plots were resampled in 2001 to ensure that differences between sites were consistent and persistent, and not due to inter-annual climatic differences. Species composition differed significantly between unburned and burned sites; eight species were identified as indicators of the unburned site and thirteen as indicators of the burned site. Plant cover was nearly twice as great in the burned site than in the unburned site in the first years of measurement and was 4.6 times greater in the burned site in 2001. Average and total species richness was greater in the burned site, explained mostly by higher numbers of native annual and biennial forbs.

It has previously been hypothesized that low rates of attack by natural enemies may contribute to the invasiveness of exotic plants. 2. We tested this hypothesis by investigating the influence of pathogens on survival during a critical life-history stage: the seed bank. We used fungicide treatments to estimate the impacts of soil fungi on buried seeds of a taxonomically broad suite of congeneric natives and exotics, in both upland and wetland meadows. 3. Seeds of both natives and exotics were recovered at lower rates in wetlands than in uplands. Fungicide addition reduced this difference by improving recovery in wetlands, indicating that the lower recovery was largely attributable to a higher level of fungal mortality. This suggests that fungal pathogens may contribute to the exclusion of upland species from wetlands. 4. The effects of fungicide on the recovery of buried seeds did not differ between natives and exotics. Seeds of exotics were recovered at a higher rate than seeds of natives in uplands, but this effect was not attributable to fungal pathogens. 5. Fungal seed pathogens may offer poor prospects for the management of most exotic species. The lack of consistent differences in the responses of natives vs. exotics to fungicide suggests few aliens owe their success to low seed pathogen loads, while impacts of seed-pathogenic biocontrol agents on non-target species would be frequent."

We examined this idea by testing if the presence of geese predicted the abundance of exotic grasses and native competitors at 2 spatial scales on 39 islands distributed throughout the Southern Gulf and San Juan Islands of Canada and the United States, respectively. At the plot level, we found significant positive relationships between the percent cover of goose feces and exotic annual grasses. However, this trend was absent at the scale of whole islands. Because rapid population expansion of introduced geese in the region only began in the 1980s, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the deleterious effects of geese on the cover of exotic annual grasses have yet to proceed beyond the local scale, and that a window of opportunity now exists in which to implement management strategies to curtail this emerging threat to native ecosystems. Research is now needed to test if the removal of geese results in the decline of exotic annual grasses."

To understand the dependence of non-native Marsh Grassbird on the non-native cordgrass, we quantified habitat use, food source, and reproductive success of the Marsh Grassbird at the Chongming Dongtan (CMDT) salt marsh. In the breeding season, we used point counts and radio-tracking to determine habitat use by Marsh Grassbirds. We analyzed basal food sources of the Marsh Grassbirds by comparing the delta(13) C isotope signatures of feather and fecal samples of birds with those of local plants. We monitored the nests through the breeding season and determined the breeding success of the Marsh Grassbirds at CMDT. Density of Marsh Grassbirds was higher where cordgrass occurred than in areas of native reed (Phragmites australis) monoculture. The breeding territory of the Marsh Grassbird was composed mainly of cordgrass stands, and nests were built exclusively against cordgrass stems. Cordgrass was the major primary producer at the base of the Marsh Grassbird food chain. Breeding success of the Marsh Grassbird at CMDT was similar to breeding success within its native range. Our results suggest non-native cordgrass provides essential habitat and food for breeding Marsh Grassbirds at CMDT and that the increase in Marsh Grassbird abundance may reflect the rapid spread of cordgrass in the coastal regions of east China. Our study provides an example of how a primary invader (i.e., cordgrass) can alter an ecosystem and thus facilitate colonization by a second non-native species.

Here, the enemy release hypothesis was tested in a marine system by excluding large enemies (>1.3 cm) in dock fouling communities in Washington, USA. After documenting the distribution and abundance of potential enemies such as chitons, gastropods and flatworms at 4 study sites, exclusion experiments were conducted to test the hypotheses that large grazing enemies (1) reduced recruitment rates in the exotic ascidian Botrylloides violaceus and native species, (2) reduced B. violaceus and native species abundance, and (3) altered fouling community structure. Experiments demonstrated that, as predicted by the enemy release hypothesis, exclusion of large enemies did not significantly alter B. violaceus recruitment or abundance and it did significantly increase abundance or recruitment of 2 common native species. However, large enemy exclusion had no significant effects on most native species or on overall fouling community structure. Furthermore, neither B. violaceus nor total exotic species abundance correlated positively with abundance of large enemies across sites. I therefore conclude that release from large enemies is likely not an important mechanism for the success of exotic species in Washington fouling communities."

This relationship was extensively studied in terrestrial systems, but it was scarcely tested in the marine environment. We investigated experimentally the interactive effects of changes in the intensity and temporal variability of mechanical disturbance by boulders on invasion dynamics of the green alga Caulerpa racemosa var. cylindracea in littoral rock pools. We tested the hypothesis that the success of invasion of C. racemosa would be (1) greater under large than under low intensity of disturbance, (2) greater under large than under low temporal variability of disturbance and that (3) interactive effects could also occur, with variability of disturbance magnifying the effects of intensity. C. racemosa was virtually absent in pools maintained under high intensity of disturbance, independently of temporal variability. High intensity of disturbance was also associated with lower density and length of fronds and thinner diameter of the stolons of the alga. The total number of native taxa and the abundance of encrusting coralline algae increased under high intensity of disturbance. Differently, turf-forming algae were positively affected by temporal variability of disturbance, while canopy-forming algae did not respond to experimental treatments. Our results suggest a direct negative effect of the most severe experimental conditions on the spread of C. racemosa in rock pools. This likely overwhelmed likely concomitant positive and negative effects mediated by resident organisms. The results of this study help anticipating invasion dynamics of C. racemosa in rock pools under climate change scenarios, in which both intensity and temporal variability of extreme meteorological events are predicted to increase."

Often characterized as a driver of change in North American woodlands, the invasive herb garlic mustard may instead respond to declines in native plant cover and diversity. We tested effects of native herb cover, richness, and light availability on garlic mustard invasion in a Minnesota oak woodland. We planted 50 garlic mustard seeds into plots previously planted with 0 to 10 native herb species. We measured garlic mustard seedling establishment, survival to rosette and adult stages, and average (per plant) and total (per plot) biomass and silique production. With the use of structural equation models, we analyzed direct, indirect, and net effects of native cover, richness, and light on successive garlic mustard life stages. Native plant cover had a significant negative effect on all life stages. Species richness had a significant positive effect on native cover, resulting in indirect negative effects on all garlic mustard stages, and net negative effects on adult numbers, total biomass, and silique production. Light had a strong negative effect on garlic mustard seedling establishment and a positive effect on native herb cover, resulting in significant negative net effects on garlic mustard rosette and adult numbers. However, light's net effect on total garlic mustard biomass and silique production was positive; reproductive output was high even in low-light/high-cover conditions. Combined effects of cover, richness, and light suggest that native herbs provide biotic resistance to invasion by responding to increased light availability and suppressing garlic mustard responses, although this resistance may be overwhelmed by high propagule pressure. Garlic mustard invasion may occur, in part, in response to native plant decline. Restoring native herbs and controlling garlic mustard seed production may effectively reduce garlic mustard spread and restore woodland diversity."

Yet, it is unclear how diversity influences invader impact, how impact varies among exotics, and what the relative importance of diversity is versus extrinsic factors that themselves can influence invasion. To address these issues, we established plant assemblages that varied in native species and functional richness and crossed this gradient in diversity with resource (water) addition. Identical assemblages were either uninvaded or invaded with one of three exotic forbs: spotted knapweed (Centaurea maculosa), dalmatian toadflax (Linaria dalmatica), or sulfur cinquefoil (Potentilla recta). To determine impacts, we measured the effects of exotics on native biomass and, for spotted knapweed, on soil moisture and nitrogen levels. Assemblages with high species richness were less invaded and less impacted than less diverse assemblages. Impact scaled with exotic biomass; spotted knapweed had the largest impact on native biomass compared with the other exotics. Although invasion depressed native biomass, the net result was to increase total community yield. Water addition increased invasibility (for knapweed only) but had no effect on invader impact. Together, these results suggest that diversity inhibits invasion and reduces impact more than resource additions facilitate invasion or impact."

In the Front Range of Colorado, Bromus tectorum (cheatgrass) and other non-native winter annuals have invaded grassland communities and are becoming more abundant. As the global climate warms, more precipitation may fall as rain rather than snow in winter, and an increase in winter rain could benefit early-growing winter annuals, such as B. tectorum, to the detriment of native species. In this study we measured the effects of simulated changes in seasonal precipitation and presence of other plant species on population growth of B. tectorum in a grassland ecosystem near Boulder, Colorado, USA. We also performed elasticity analyses to identify life transitions that were most sensitive to precipitation differences. In both study years, population growth rates were highest for B. tectorum growing in treatments receiving supplemental winter precipitation and lowest for those receiving the summer drought treatment. Survival of seedlings to flowering and seed production contributed most to population growth in all treatments. Biomass of neighboring native plants was positively correlated with reduced population growth rates of B. tectorum. However, exotic plant biomass had no effect on population growth rates. This study demonstrates how interacting effects of climate change and presence of native plants can influence the population growth of an invasive species. Overall, our results suggest that B. tectorum will become more invasive in grasslands if the seasonality of precipitation shifts towards wetter winters and allows B. tectorum to grow when competition from native species is low."

Understanding plant tolerance to herbivory under different environmental conditions will help to improve biocontrol efficacy. The invasive alligator weed (Alternanthera philoxeroides) has been successfully controlled by natural enemies in many aquatic habitats but not in terrestrial environments worldwide. This study examined the effects of different levels of simulated leaf herbivory on the growth of alligator weed at two levels of fertilization and three levels of soil moisture (aquatic, semi-aquatic, and terrestrial habitats). Increasing levels of simulated (manual) defoliation generally caused decreases in total biomass in all habitats. However, the plant appeared to respond differently to high levels of herbivory in the three habitats. Terrestrial plants showed the highest below-above ground mass ratio (R/S), indicating the plant is more tolerant to herbivory in terrestrial habitats than in aquatic habitats. The unfertilized treatment exhibited greater tolerance than the fertilized treatment in the terrestrial habitat at the first stage of this experiment (day 15), but fertilizer appears not to have influenced tolerance at the middle and last stages of the experiment. No such difference was found in semi-aquatic and aquatic habitats. These findings suggest that plant tolerance is affected by habitats and soil nutrients and this relationship could influence the biological control outcome. Plant compensatory response to herbivory under different environmental conditions should, therefore, be carefully considered when planning to use biological control in management programs against invasive plants.

The link between disturbance and invasion potential has rarely been studied in the marine environment where dominance hierarchies, dynamics of larval supply, and resource acquisition may differ greatly from terrestrial systems. In this study, hard substrate marine communities in Long Island Sound, USA were used to assess the effect of disturbance on resident species and recent invaders, ascidian growth form (i.e. colonial and solitary growth form), and the dominant species-specific responses within the community. Community age was an additional factor considered through manipulation of 5-wk old assemblages and 1-yr old assemblages. Disturbance treatments, exposing primary substrate, were characterized by frequency (single, biweekly, monthly) and magnitude (20%, 48%, 80%) of disturbance. In communities of different ages, disturbance frequency had a significant positive effect on space occupation of recent invaders and a significant negative effect on resident species. In the 5-wk community, magnitude of disturbance also had a significant effect. Disturbance also had a significant effect on ascidian growth form; colonial species occupied more primary space than controls in response to increased disturbance frequency and magnitude. In contrast, solitary species occupied significantly less space than controls. Species-specific responses were similar regardless of community age. The non-native colonial ascidian Diplosoma listerianum responded positively to increased disturbance frequency and magnitude, and occupied more primary space in treatments than in controls. The resident solitary ascidian Molgula manhattensis responded negatively to increased disturbance frequency and magnitude, and occupied less primary space in treatments than in controls. Small-scale biological disturbances, by creating space, may facilitate the success of invasive species and colonial organisms in the development of subtidal hard substrate communities.

Centaurea stoebe can establish virtual monocultures in parts of its non-native range, but occurs at far lower abundances where it is native. We conducted parallel experiments at four European and four Montana (USA) grassland sites with all factorial combinations of +/- suppression of soil fungi, +/- disturbance and low versus high knapweed propagule pressure [100 or 300 knapweed seeds per 0.3mx0.3m plot (1000 or 3000per m2)]. We also measured germination in buried bags containing locally collected knapweed seeds that were either treated or not with fungicide. Disturbance and propagule pressure increased knapweed recruitment and establishment, but did so similarly in both ranges. Treating plots with fungicides had no effect on recruitment or establishment in either range. However, we found: (i) greater seedling recruitment and plant establishment in undisturbed plots in Montana compared to undisturbed plots in Europe and (ii) substantially greater germination of seeds in bags buried in Montana compared to Europe. Also, across all treatments, total plant establishment was greater in Montana than in Europe. Synthesis. Our results highlight the importance of simultaneously examining processes that could influence invasion in both ranges. They indicate that under background' undisturbed conditions, knapweed recruits and establishes at greater abundance in Montana than in Europe. However, our results do not support the importance of soil fungi or local disturbances as mechanisms for knapweed's differential success in North America versus Europe."

The ecological effect of the A. getulus squirrel was compared to that of another introduced mammal (the rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus) and a native seed disperser (the lizard Gallotia atlantica). Fleshy fruits were an essential food and water resource in this xeric island. Coinciding with maximum fruit availability, consumption of native plant fruits occurred mainly in the spring while introduced plants were ingested in autumn. A significant number of Rubia fruticosa fruits were consumed by lizards, whereas squirrels ate a large amount of Lycium intricatum fruits. Asparagus pastorianus was consumed in similar quantities by each of the three fruit consumers. Fruits from Opuntia were mainly eaten by the squirrels. Lizards should be considered as legitimate seed dispersers for the three native species, while the two mammals are illegitimate dispersal agents. However, in the case of the non-native Opuntia, squirrels produce an invasional meltdown effect in the colonization of this cactus on Fuerteventura Island. While this invasive squirrel plays a significant negative predatory role on native seed plants, it is an effective disperser of some introduced plants. Thus, it constitutes an appropriate example from which to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the disruption impacts of introduced species in island ecosystems. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

However, it is unclear if growth limitations can explain upper range limits and whether phenotypic plasticity or genetic changes allow species to occupy a broad elevational gradient. Aims: We investigated how non-native plant individuals from different elevations responded to growing season temperatures, which represented conditions at the core and margin of the elevational distributions of the species. Methods: We recorded the occurrence of nine non-native species in the Swiss Alps and subsequently conducted a climate chamber experiment to assess growth rates of plants from different elevations under different temperature treatments. Results: The elevational limit observed in the field was not related to the species' temperature response in the climate chamber experiment. Almost all species showed a similar level of reduction in growth rates under lower temperatures independent of the upper elevational limit of the species' distribution. For two species we found indications for genetic differentiation among plants from different elevations. Conclusions: We conclude that factors other than growing season temperatures, such as extreme events or winter mortality, might shape the elevational limit of non-native species, and that ecological filtering might select for genotypes that are phenotypically plastic."

The biodiversity-invasibility hypothesis postulates that species-rich communities are less vulnerable to invasion because vacant niches are less common and the intensity of interspecific competition is more severe. Field studies were conducted at two sites, a logged site and an unlogged site in Santa Rosa County, Florida, U.S.A, to test Elton's hypothesis using cogongrass (Imperata cylindrica), a non-indigenous grass invading large areas of the Southeastern United States. The logged site was under 17-year-old loblolly pine prior to clear cutting. The unlogged site, a longleaf pine forest, was at the Blackwater River State Forest. Both the logged site and unlogged site showed no significant relationship between the rate of cogongrass spread and native plant species richness, functional richness, and cover of the invaded community. Increased species or functional richness may increase the use of resources; however, the extensive rhizome/root network possessed by cogongrass and its ability to thrive under shade may allow for its persistence in a diverse community. The results from both the logged and unlogged sites do not support the general hypothesis of Elton that invasion resistance and compositional stability increase with diversity. Biodiversity does not appear to be an important factor for cogongrass invasion in the southern United States. Extrinsic factors in this study prevent the ability to draw a defined causal relationship between native plant diversity and invasibility. Underlying reasons for why no relationship was observed may be simply due to the tremendous competitive ability of cogongrass or the narrow range of species richness, functional richness and cover observed in our study."

In their colonized ranges, exotic plants may be released from some of the herbivores or pathogens of their home ranges but these can be replaced by novel enemies. It is of basic and practical interest to understand which characteristics of invaded communities control accumulation of the new pests. Key questions are whether enemy load on exotic species is smaller than on native competitors as suggested by the enemy release hypothesis (ERH) and whether this difference is most pronounced in resource-rich habitats as predicted by the resource-enemy release hypothesis (R-ERH). 2. In 72 populations of 12 exotic invasive species, we scored all visible above-ground damage morphotypes caused by herbivores and fungal pathogens. In addition, we quantified levels of leaf herbivory and fruit damage. We then assessed whether variation in damage diversity and levels was explained by habitat fertility, by relatedness between exotic species and the native community or rather by native species diversity. 3. In a second part of the study, we also tested the ERH and the R-ERH by comparing damage of plants in 28 pairs of co-occurring native and exotic populations, representing nine congeneric pairs of native and exotic species. 4. In the first part of the study, diversity of damage morphotypes and damage levels of exotic populations were greater in resource-rich habitats.

Originating in the Ponto-Caspian region, this invader has caused significant degradation of European freshwater ecosystems by predating and competitively excluding native invertebrate species. In contrast to continental Europe, in which invasions occurred through the migration of large numbers of individuals along rivers and canals, the invasion of Great Britain must have involved long distance dispersal across the sea. This makes the loss of genetic diversity and of debilitating parasites more likely. Analysis of nuclear microsatellite loci and mitochondrial DNA sequences of D. villosus samples from the four known populations in Britain reveal loss of rare alleles, in comparison to reference populations from the west coast of continental Europe. Screening of the British D. villosus populations by PCR detected no microsporidian parasites, in contrast with continental populations of D. villosus and native amphipod populations, most of which are infected with microsporidia. These findings suggest that the initial colonisation of Great Britain and subsequent long distance dispersal within Britain were associated with genetic founder effects and enemy release due to loss of parasites. Such effects are also likely to occur during future long-distance dispersal events of D. villosus to Ireland or North America."

However, few studies have examined release from herbivory as a mechanism of invasion in oceanic island systems, which have experienced particularly high loss of native species due to the invasion of non-native animal and plant species. We surveyed putative defensive traits and leaf damage rates in 19 pairs of taxonomically related invasive and native species in Hawaii, representing a broad taxonomic diversity. Leaf damage by insects and pathogens was monitored in both wet and dry seasons. We found that native species had higher leaf damage rates than invasive species, but only during the dry season. However, damage rates across native and invasive species averaged only 2% of leaf area. Native species generally displayed high levels of structural defense (leaf toughness and leaf thickness, but not leaf trichome density) while native and invasive species displayed similar levels of chemical defenses (total phenolics). A defense index, which integrated all putative defense traits, was significantly higher for native species, suggesting that native species may allocate fewer resources to growth and reproduction than do invasive species. Thus, our data support the idea that invasive species allocate fewer resources to defense traits, allowing them to outperform native species through increased growth and reproduction. While strong impacts of herbivores on invasion are not supported by the low damage rates we observed on mature plants, population-level studies that monitor how herbivores influence recruitment, mortality, and competitive outcomes are needed to accurately address how herbivores influence invasion in Hawaii."

Reduced top-down control (""enemy release"") following this escape is often invoked to explain demographic expansion of invasive species and also may alter the selective regime for invasive species: reduced damage can allow resources previously allocated to defence to be reallocated to other functions like growth and reproduction. This reallocation may provide invaders with an ""evolution of increased competitive ability"" over natives that defend themselves against specialist enemies. We tested for enemy release and the evolution of increased competitive ability in the North American native ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifblia: Asteraceae), which currently is invading France. We found evidence of enemy release in natural field populations from the invaded and native ranges. Further we carried out a reciprocal transplant experiment, comparing several life history traits of plants from two North American (Ontario and South Carolina) and one French population in four common gardens on both continents. French and Canadian plants had similar flowering phenologies, flowering earlier than plants from further south in the native range. This may suggest that invasive French plants originated from similar latitudes to the Canadian population sampled. As with natural populations, experimental plants suffered far less herbivore damage in France than in Ontario. This difference in herbivory translated into increased growth but not into increased size or vigour. Moreover, we found that native genotypes were as damaged as invading ones in all experimental sites, suggesting no evolutionary loss of defence against herbivores."

Exotics can facilitate establishment and invasion of other exotics (invasional meltdown) or they can restrict them by re-establishing natural population control (as predicted by the enemy-release hypothesis). We studied forest invasion on an Argentinean island where 43 species of Pinaceae, including 60% of the world's recorded invasive Pinaceae, were introduced c. 1920 but where few species are colonizing pristine areas. In this area two species of Palearctic deer, natural enemies of most Pinaceae, were introduced 80 years ago. Expecting deer to help to control the exotics, we conducted a cafeteria experiment to assess deer preferences among the two dominant native species (a conifer, Austrocedrus chilensis, and a broadleaf, Nothofagus dombeyi) and two widely introduced exotic tree species (Pseudotsuga menziesii and Pinus ponderosa). Deer browsed much more intensively on native species than on exotic conifers, in terms of number of individuals attacked and degree of browsing. Deer preference for natives could potentially facilitate invasion by exotic pines. However, we hypothesize that the low rates of invasion currently observed can result at least partly from high densities of exotic deer, which, despite their preference for natives, can prevent establishment of both native and exotic trees. Other factors, not mutually exclusive, could produce the observed pattern. Our results underscore the difficulty of predicting how one introduced species will effect impact of another one."

Species diversity, richness, and abundance were highest in prairie, and were higher in mixed woodland than in S. sebiferum. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling distinguished orders and families of arthropods, and families of herbivores in S. sebiferum from mixed woodland and coastal prairie. Taxonomic similarity between S. sebiferum and mixed woodland was 51%. Fauna from S. sebiferum in 2001 was more similar to mixed woodland than to samples from S. sebiferun collected in 1982. These results indicate that the entomofauna in S. sebiferum originated from mixed prairie and that, with time, these faunas became more similar. Species richness and abundance of herbivores was lower in S. sebiferum, but proportion of total species in all trophic groups, except herbivores, was higher in S. sebifintm than mixed woodland. Low concentration of tannin in leaves of S. sebiferum did not explain low loss of leaves to herbivores. Lower abundance of herbivores on introduced species of plants fits the enemy release hypothesis, and low concentration of defense compounds in the face of low number of herbivores fits the evolution of increased competitive ability hypothesis."

Quantification of invasive lionfish abundances, along with potentially important physical and biological environmental characteristics, permitted inferences about the invasion process of reefs on the island of San Salvador in the Bahamas. Environmental wave-exposure had a large influence on lionfish abundance, which was more than 20 and 120 times greater for density and biomass respectively at sheltered sites as compared with wave-exposed environments. Our measurements of topographic complexity of the reefs revealed that lionfish abundance was not driven by habitat rugosity. Lionfish abundance was not negatively affected by the abundance of large native predators (or large native groupers) and was also unrelated to the abundance of medium prey fishes (total length of 5-10 cm). These relationships suggest that (1) higher-energy environments may impose intrinsic resistance against lionfish invasion, (2) habitat complexity may not facilitate the lionfish invasion process, (3) predation or competition by native fishes may not provide biotic resistance against lionfish invasion, and (4) abundant prey fish might not facilitate lionfish invasion success. The relatively low biomass of large grouper on this island could explain our failure to detect suppression of lionfish abundance and we encourage continuing the preservation and restoration of potential lionfish predators in the Caribbean. In addition, energetic environments might exert direct or indirect resistance to the lionfish proliferation, providing native fish populations with essential refuges."

There are multifold attempts to counter alien species, but limited resources for mitigation or eradication programmes makes prioritisation indispensable. We used the generic impact scoring system to assess the impact of alien fish species in Europe. It prioritises species, but also offers the possibility to compare the impact of alien invasive species between different taxonomic groups. For alien fish in Europe, we compiled a list of 40 established species. By literature research, we assessed the environmental impact (through herbivory, predation, competition, disease transmission, hybridisation and ecosystem alteration) and economic impact (on agriculture, animal production, forestry, human infrastructure, human health and human social life) of each species. The goldfish/gibel complex Carassius auratus/C.gibelio scored the highest impact points, followed by the grass carp Ctenopharyngodon idella and the topmouth gudgeon Pseudorasbora parva. According to our analyses, alien fish species have the strongest impact on the environment through predation, followed by competition with native species. Besides negatively affecting animal production (mainly in aquaculture), alien fish have no pronounced economic impact. At the species level, C.auratus/C.gibelio show similar impact scores to the worst alien mammals in Europe. This study indicates that the generic impact scoring system is useful to investigate the impact of alien fish, also allowing cross-taxa comparisons. Our results are therefore of major relevance for stakeholders and decision-makers involved in management and eradication of alien fish species."

Periodic hypoxia represents a pulse disturbance, with the potential to restructure estuarine biotic communities. We chose the shallow, epifaunal community in the lower Chesapeake Bay, Virginia, USA, to test the hypothesis that low dissolved oxygen (DO) (< 4 mg l(-1)) affects community dynamics by reducing the cover of spatial dominants, creating space both for less dominant native species and for invasive species, Settling panels were deployed at shallow depths in spring 2000 and 2001. at Gloucester Point, Virginia, and were manipulated every 2 wk from late June to mid-August. Manipulation involved exposing epifaunal communities to varying levels of DO for up to 24 h followed by redeployment in the York River. Exposure to low DO affected both species composition (presence or absence) and the abundance of the organisms present. Community dominance shifted away from barnacles as level of hypoxia increased. Barnacles were important spatial dominants which reduced species diversity when locally abundant. The cover of Hydroides dianthus, a native serpulid polychaete, doubled when exposed to periodic hypoxia. Increased H. dianthus cover may indicate whether a local region has experienced periodic, local DO depletion and thus provide an indicator of poor water-quality conditions. In 2001, the combined cover of the invasive and cryptogenic species in this community, Botryllus schlosseri (tunicate), Molgula manhattensis (tunicate), Ficopomatus enigmaticus (polychaete) and Diadumene lineata (anemone), was highest on the plates exposed to moderately low DO (2 mg l(-1) < DO < 4 mg l(-1)). All 4 of these species are now found worldwide and exhibit life histories well adapted for establishment in foreign habitats. Low DO events may enhance success of invasive species, which further stress marine and estuarine ecosystems."

Within each waterbody, we compared the abundance, diversity, and community composition of epiphytic macroinvertebrates on exotic and native Myriophyllum. In general, both M. sibericum and M. alterniflorum had higher invertebrate diversity and higher invertebrate biomass and supported more gastropods than the exotic M. spicatum. In late summer, invertebrate density tended to be higher on M. sibericum than on M. spicatum, but lower on M. alterniflorum than on M. spicatum. Our results demonstrate that M. spicatum supports macroinvertebrate communities that may differ from those on structurally similar native macrophytes, although these differences vary across sites and sampling dates. Thus, the replacement of native milfoils by M. spicatum may have indirect effects on aquatic food webs."

We combine analyses that: (1) characterize the soil and measure concentrations of heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) where Conium is growing; (2) assess the genetic diversity and structure of individuals among nine known populations; and (3) test for tolerance to heavy metals and evidence for local soil growth advantage with greenhouse establishment experiments. We found elevated levels of metals and PAHs in the soil where Conium was growing. Specifically, arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), and lead (Pb) were found at elevated levels relative to U.S. EPA ecological contamination thresholds. In a greenhouse study we found that Conium is more tolerant of soils containing heavy metals (As, Cd, Pb) than two native species. For the genetic analysis a total of 217 individuals (approximately 20-30 per population) were scored with 5 ISSR primers, yielding 114 variable loci. We found high levels of genetic diversity in all populations but little genetic structure or differentiation among populations. Although Conium shows a general tolerance to contamination, we found few significant associations between genetic diversity metrics and a suite of measured environmental and spatial parameters. Soil contamination is not driving the peculiar spatial distribution of Conium in Cook County, but these findings indicate that Conium is likely establishing in the Chicago region partially due to its ability to tolerate high levels of metal contamination."

Studies testing these hypotheses have shown mixed support. We tested these hypotheses using the establishment success of non-native reptiles and congener presence/absence and richness across the globe. Our results demonstrated support for the pre-adaptation hypothesis. We found that globally, both on islands and continents, establishment success was higher in the presence than in the absence of congeners and that establishment success increased with increasing congener richness. At the life form level, establishment success was higher for lizards, marginally higher for snakes, and not different for turtles in the presence of congeners; data were insufficient to test the hypotheses for crocodiles. There was no relationship between establishment success and congener richness for any life form. We suggest that we found support for the pre-adaptation hypothesis because, at the scale of our analysis, native congeners represent environmental conditions appropriate for the species rather than competition for niche space. Our results imply that areas to target for early detection of non-native reptiles are those that host closely related species."

In particular, the spread of alien plant species along such gradients might be limited by their ability to establish clinal patterns of trait variation. We investigated trends in growth and reproductive traits in natural populations of eight invasive Asteraceae forbs along altitudinal gradients in their native and introduced ranges (Valais, Switzerland, and Wallowa Mountains, Oregon, USA). Plants showed similar responses to altitude in both ranges, being generally smaller and having fewer inflorescences but larger seeds at higher altitudes. However, these trends were modified by region-specific effects that were independent of species status ( native or introduced), suggesting that any differential performance of alien species in the introduced range cannot be interpreted without a fully reciprocal approach to test the basis of these differences. Furthermore, we found differences in patterns of resource allocation to capitula among species in the native and the introduced areas. These suggest that the mechanisms underlying trait variation, for example, increasing seed size with altitude, might differ between ranges. The rapid establishment of clinal patterns of trait variation in the new range indicates that the need to respond to altitudinal gradients, possibly by local adaptation, has not limited the ability of these species to invade mountain regions. Studies are now needed to test the underlying mechanisms of altitudinal clines in traits of alien species."

How-ever, only a small proportion of these programs has been planned and monitored scientifically and comparative multi-species studies are missing in this context. Therefore, the relative importance of fac-tors involved in reintroduction success is poorly known. In 2007, we assessed population growth since introduction as a measure of establishment success of 25 wetland species (rare or extinct in the wild nationwide) and a total of 50 populations in Switzerland that had been introduced at seven restored sites with apparently adequate environmental conditions between 1997 and 2005. We related establishment success to 32 life-history traits of these species obtained from the BiolFlor database, to initial number of introduced plants (propagule pressure with 1-130 individuals introduced per population), and to the ecological distance between source sites and restored sites based on vegetation records. Our results clearly showed the importance of close ecological similarity between source and introduction sites for successful establishment of wetland species into restored pond habitats. In contrast, neither life-history traits nor propagule pressure were related to establishment success in our study. Based on our results, we strongly recommend enforcing ecological studies prior to reintroduction to accurately assess the suitabil-ity of restored sites. To unambiguously assess the key determinants of successful establishment, future reintroduction programs should be set-up according to experimental designs."

Since its discovery in New Jersey in 1988, the Asian shore crab (Hemigrapsus sanguineus) has continued to expand its range, invading estuarine and coastal habitats in eastern North America. In estuarine environments, H. sanguineus occupies similar habitats to native, panopeid mud crabs. These crabs, and a variety of fouling organisms (both NIS and native), often inhabit man-made substrates (like piers and riprap) and anthropogenic debris. In a series of in situ experiments at a closed dock in southwestern Long Island (New York, USA), we documented the impacts of these native and introduced crabs on hard-substrate fouling communities. We found that while the presence of native mud crabs did not significantly influence the succession of fouling communities compared to caged and uncaged controls, the presence of introduced H. sanguineus reduced the biomass of native tunicates (particularly Molgula manhattensis), relative to caged controls. Moreover, the presence of H. sanguineus favored fouling communities dominated by introduced tunicates (especially Botrylloides violaceous and Diplosoma listerianum). Altogether, our results suggest that H. sanguineus could help facilitate introduced fouling tunicates in the region, particularly in locations where additional solid substrates have created novel habitats."

A project to evaluate the impact of American mink has been carried out in Catalonia since 2000 under the aegis of regional and national government and a European LIFE pro-gramme. In this study, we tested whether temporal variations in the relative abundance of native species were related to American mink. In addition, we compared the abundance of natives before and after mink arrival. Among the competitors spotted genet and European polecat, mink abundance and arrival had a significant negative effect on their populations. However, among black rat and fish prey only three native fish species had a negative temporal relation with the abundance of mink and three fish species showed a significant difference in their abundance before and after mink arrival. The effect of mink was significant among species with a higher niche overlap (polecat and genet versus mink). The persistence and coexistence of the alien and native species seems to depend on hetero-geneity, in terms of the based on niche segregation among these species."

Plants in invaded habitats exhibited a correlated increase in longevity and decrease in overall size in the transition into more stressful mesic habitats. In contrast, plants in the native range only exhibited a decrease in height.

However, few studies have tested this hypothesis in native and introduced regions. A biogeographical approach is fundamental to understanding the mechanisms involved in plant invasions and to detect rapid evolutionary changes in the introduced area. Reproduction was assessed in native and introduced ranges of two invasive Australian woody legumes, Acacia dealbata and A.longifolia. Seed production, pre-dispersal seed predation, seed and elaiosome size and seedling size were assessed in 7-10 populations from both ranges, taking into account the effect of differences in climate. There was a significantly higher percentage of fully developed seeds per pod, a lower proportion of aborted seeds and the absence of pre-dispersal predation in the introduced range for both Acacia species. Acacia longifolia produced more seeds per pod in the invaded range, whereas A.dealbata produced more seeds per tree in the invaded range. Seeds were bigger in the invaded range for both species, and elaiosome: seed ratio was smaller for A.longifolia in the invaded range. Seedlings were also larger in the invaded range, suggesting that the increase in seed size results into greater offspring growth. There were no differences in the climatic conditions of sites occupied by A.longifolia in both regions. Minimum temperature was higher in Portuguese A.dealbata populations, but this difference did not explain the increase in seed production and seed size in the introduced range. It did have, however, a positive effect on the number of pods per tree.Synthesis. Acacia dealbata and A.longifolia escape pre-dispersal predation in the introduced range and display a higher production of fully developed seeds per fruit and bigger seeds. These differences may explain the invasion of both species because they result in an increased seedling growth and the production of abundant soil seedbanks in the introduced area."

In order to determine the resilience of local communities to invasion by non-native spiders, we compared spider assemblages from areas with varying numbers of non-native spiders in California coastal sage scrub. Spiders were collected from pitfall traps over 2 years. Productive lowland coastal sites contained both the highest proportion of non-natives and the greatest number of spiders overall. We detected no negative associations between native and non-native spiders and therefore suggest that non-native spiders are not presently impacting local ground-dwelling spiders. Strong positive correlations between abundances of some natives and non-natives may be the result of similar habitat preferences or of facilitation between species. We propose that the effects of non-native species depend on resource availability and site productivity, which, in turn, affect community resilience. Our results support the contention that both invasibility and resilience are higher in diverse, highly linked communities with high resource availability rather than the classical view that species poor communities are more invasible.

We tested this prediction by comparing herbivore pressure on native European and introduced North American populations of Hypericum perforatum (St John's Wort). We found that introduced populations occur at larger densities, are less damaged by insect herbivory and suffer less mortality than populations in the native range. However, overall population size was not significantly different between ranges. Moreover, on average plants were significantly smaller in the introduced range than in the native range. Our survey supports the contention that plants from the introduced range experience less herbivore damage than plants from the native range. While this may lead to denser populations, it does not result in larger plant size in the introduced versus native range as postulated by the ERH."

In this study, we use a trait-based null modelling approach to test for evidence of deterministic assembly of species according to flowering time in an old-field plant community. Plant species coexisting in one-metre-square plots overlapped in flowering time significantly more than expected. This flowering synchrony was more pronounced when analyses focused on bee-pollinated species. Flowering synchrony was also observed for wind-pollinated species, although for only one of our two null model tests, highlighting the sensitivity of some results to different randomization methods. In general, these patterns suggest that relationships between pollinators and plants can influence community assembly processes. Because our study community is composed of approximately 43% native plant species and 57% exotic species, and because the arrival of new species may complicate plantpollinator interactions, we tested whether flowering time overlap was altered by introduced species. Flowering synchrony was greater in plots with a higher proportion of introduced species. This pattern held for both null model tests, but was slightly stronger when analyses focused on bee-pollinated species. These results indicate that introduced species alter community flowering distributions and in so doing will inevitably affect pollinatorplant interactions. Finally, we tested whether our results were influenced by variation among study plots in above-ground biomass production, which some theory predicts will be related to the importance of competition. Our results were not influenced by this variation, suggesting that resource variation among our plots did not contribute to observed patterns. Synthesis: Our results provide support for predictions that coexisting species should display flowering synchrony, and provide no support for species coexistence via temporal niche partitioning at this scale in this study community. Our results also indicate that introduced species significantly alter the community assembly process such that flowering synchrony is more pronounced in plots with a greater proportion of introduced plant species."

We collected capitula from individuals in ten field populations, along an invasion route including the original introduction site in southern France. In addition, we conducted a common garden experiment from field-collected seeds and obtained capitula from individuals representing the same ten field populations. We analysed phenotypic variation in dispersal traits between field and common garden environments as a function of the distance between populations and the introduction site. Our results revealed low levels of phenotypic differentiation among populations. However, significant clinal variation in dispersal traits was demonstrated in common garden plants representing the invasion route. In field populations, similar trends in dispersal-related traits and evidence of an Allee effect were not detected. In part, our results supported expectations of increased dispersal capacity with range expansion, and emphasized the contribution of phenotypic plasticity under natural conditions."

The impacts of largemouth bass and bluegill on native fauna have been examined in aquaria and isolated farm ponds, but there is limited work examining the likelihood to fundamentally modifying Japan's lakes. The objective of the present study is to examine the direct and synergistic ecological effects of largemouth bass and bluegill on the biotic communities of Lake Kawahara-oike, Nagasaki, Japan, using an ecosystem (Ecopath) modeling approach. Specifically, we examine whether the two fish species have played a critical role in shaping the trophodynamics of the lake. We attempt to shed light on the trophic interactions between largemouth bass and bluegill and subsequently evaluate to what extent these interactions facilitate their establishment at the expense of native species. We also examine how these changes propagate through the Lake Kawahara-oike food web. Our study suggests that the introduction of bluegill has induced a range of changes at multiple trophic levels. The present analysis also provides evidence that largemouth bass was unable to exert significant top-down control on the growth rates of the bluegill population. Largemouth bass and bluegill appear to prevail over the native fish species populations and can apparently coexist in large numbers in invaded lakes. Future management strategies controlling invasive species are urgently required, if the integrity of native Japanese fish communities is to be protected. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

We hypothesized that altered soil microbial populations owing to disturbance would contribute to invasion by cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), an exotic annual grass, at the expense of the native perennial grass, squirreltail (Elymus elymoides). Using a greenhouse experiment, we compared the responses of conspecific and heterospecific pairs of cheatgrass and squirreltail inoculated with soil (including live AM spores and other organisms) collected from fuel treatments with high, intermediate and no disturbance (pile burns, mastication, and intact woodlands) and a sterile control. Cheatgrass growth was unaffected by type of soil inoculum, whereas squirreltail growth, reproduction and nutrient uptake were higher in plants inoculated with soil from mastication and undisturbed treatments compared to pile burns and sterile controls. Squirreltail shoot biomass was positively correlated with AM colonization when inoculated with mastication and undisturbed soils, but not when inoculated with pile burn soils. In contrast, cheatgrass shoot biomass was negatively correlated with AM colonization, but this effect was less pronounced with pile burn inoculum. Cheatgrass had higher foliar N and P when grown with squirreltail compared to a conspecific, while squirreltail had lower foliar P, AM colonization and flower production when grown with cheatgrass. These results indicate that changes in AM communities resulting from high disturbance may favor exotic plant species that do not depend on mycorrhizal fungi, over native species that depend on particular taxa of AM fungi for growth and reproduction."

Though examples of mutually beneficial interactions between exotic species are known, few studies have quantified these effects or identified specific mechanisms. We used the co-invasion of an endangered island ecosystem by exotic Canada geese (Branta canadensis) and nine exotic annual grasses to study the effects of an invading herbivore on the success of invading grasses. On our study islands in southwestern Canada, we found that geese fed selectively on the exotic grasses and avoided native forbs. Counter to current theory suggesting that the grasses should be limited by a selective enemy, however, the grasses increased in proportional abundance under grazing whereas forbs showed declining abundance. Testing potential mechanisms for the effects of grazing on grasses, we found that the grasses produced more stems per area when grazing reduced vegetation height and prevented litter accumulation. Forming dense mats of short stems appeared to be an efficient reproductive and competitive strategy that the Eurasian grasses have evolved in the presence of grazers, conferring a competitive advantage in a system where the native species pool has very few annual grasses and no grazers. Germination trials further demonstrated that selective herbivory by geese enables their dispersal of exotic grass seed between heavily invaded feeding areas and the small islands used for nesting. In summary, the exotic geese facilitated both the local increase and the spatial spread of exotic grasses, which in turn provided the majority of their diet. This unexpected case of positive feedback between exotic species suggests that invasion success may depend on the overall differences between the evolutionary histories of the invaders and the evolutionary history of the native community they enter."

Wetlands in urban regions are subjected to a wide variety of anthropogenic disturbances, many of which may promote invasions of exotic plant species. In order to devise management strategies, the influence of different aspects of the urban and natural environments on invasion and community structure must be understood. 2. The roles of soil variables, anthropogenic effects adjacent to and within the wetlands, and vegetation structure on exotic species occurrence within 21 forested wetlands in north-eastern New Jersey, USA, were compared. The hypotheses were tested that different vegetation strata and different invasive species respond similarly to environmental factors, and that invasion increases with increasing direct human impact, hydrologic disturbance, adjacent residential land use and decreasing wetland area. Canonical correspondence analyses, correlation and logistic regression analyses were used to examine invasion by individual species and overall site invasion, as measured by the absolute and relative number of exotic species in the site flora. 3. Within each stratum, different sets of environmental factors separated exotic and native species. Nutrients, soil clay content and pH, adjacent land use and canopy composition were the most frequently identified factors affecting species, but individual species showed highly individualistic responses to the sets of environmental variables, often responding in opposite ways to the same factor. 4. Overall invasion increased with decreasing area but only when sites > 100 ha were included. Unexpectedly, invasion decreased with increasing proportions of industrial/commercial adjacent land use. 5. The hypotheses were only partially supported; invasion does not increase in a simple way with increasing human presence and disturbance. 6. Synthesis and applications. The results suggest that a suite of environmental conditions can be identified that are associated with invasion into urban wetlands, which can be widely used for assessment and management. However, a comprehensive ecosystem approach is needed that places the remediation of physical alterations from urbanization within a landscape context. Specifically, sediment, inputs and hydrologic changes need to be related to adjoining urban land use and to the overlapping requirements of individual native and exotic species."

However, to benefit from enemy escape, invasive plants must also escape or resist specialist or generalist herbivores that attack related species in the introduced range. We compared insect herbivore damage on the exotic shrub, Lonicera maackii, the native congener Lonicera reticulata, and the native confamilial Viburnum prunifolium in North America. We also compared the laboratory preference and performance of a North American honeysuckle specialist sawfly (Zaraea inflata) and the performance of a widespread generalist caterpillar (Spodoptera frugiperda) on cut foliage from native and exotic Lonicera species. L. maackii received significantly lower amounts of foliar herbivory than L. reticulata across three seasons, while damage levels observed on V. prunifolium for two seasons was generally intermediate between L. reticulata and L. maackii. The specialist sawfly damaged L. reticulata heavily, but was not detected on L. maackii in the field. There were few statistical differences in the performance of sawfly larvae on L. reticulata and L. maackii, but the sawfly achieved higher pupal masses on L. reticulata than on L. maackii, and they strongly preferred L. reticulata over L. maackii when given a choice. The sawfly was unable to complete development on native L. sempervirens and non-native L. japonica. In contrast, the generalist caterpillar performed similarly on all Lonicera species. While L. maackii experienced little herbivory in the field compared to native relatives in the same habitat, laboratory assays indicate L. maackii appears to be a suitable host that escapes selection by the specialist, but L. japonica and L. sempervirens are highly resistant to it. These findings indicate that both enemy escape and resistance (to a specialist, but not a generalist herbivore) may contribute to the success of exotic Lonicera species."

One key aspect is how non-natives interact with the local biota. Interaction with local species may be especially important for exotic species that require an obligatory mutualist, such as Pinaceae species that need ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi. EM fungi and seeds of Pinaceae disperse independently, so they may use different vectors. We studied the role of exotic mammals as dispersal agents of EM fungi on Isla Victoria, Argentina, where many Pinaceae species have been introduced. Only a few of these tree species have become invasive, and they are found in high densities only near plantations, partly because these Pinaceae trees lack proper EM fungi when their seeds land far from plantations. Native mammals (a dwarf deer and rodents) are rare around plantations and do not appear to play a role in these invasions. With greenhouse experiments using animal feces as inoculum, plus observational and molecular studies, we found that wild boar and deer, both non-native, are dispersing EM fungi. Approximately 30% of the Pinaceae seedlings growing with feces of wild boar and 15% of the seedlings growing with deer feces were colonized by non-native EM fungi. Seedlings growing in control pots were not colonized by EM fungi. We found a low diversity of fungi colonizing the seedlings, with the hypogeous Rhizopogon as the most abundant genus. Wild boar, a recent introduction to the island, appear to be the main animal dispersing the fungi and may be playing a key role in facilitating the invasion of pine trees and even triggering their spread. These results show that interactions among non-natives help explain pine invasions in our study area."

Our specific objectives were to assess the temporal and spatial patterns of exotic plant species in a native grassland in Kansas (USA) and to determine the factors that control exotic species abundance and richness (i.e., invasibility). Exotic species (90% C3 plants) comprised approximately 10% of the flora, and their turnover was relatively high (30%) over the 15-year period. We found that disturbances significantly affected the abundance and richness of exotic species. In particular, long-term annually burned watersheds had lower cover of exotic species than unburned watersheds, and fire reduced exotic species richness by 80-90%. Exotic and native species richness were positively correlated across sites subjected to different fire (r = 0.72) and grazing (r = 0.67) treatments, and the number of exotic species was lowest on sites with the highest productivity of C4 grasses (i.e., high dominance). These results provide strong evidence for the role of community structure, as affected by disturbance, in determining invasibility of this grassland. Moreover, a significant positive relationship between exotic and native species richness was observed within a disturbance regime (annually burned sites, r = 0.51; unburned sites, r = 0.59). Thus, invasibility of this C4-dominated grassland can also be directly related to community structure independent of disturbance."

At the 1000-m(2) plot scale (among vegetation types), 83% of the variance in exotic species richness in the Central Grasslands was explained by the total percentage of nitrogen in the soil and the cover of native plant species. In the Colorado Rockies, 69% of the variance in exotic species richness in 1000-m(2) plots was explained by the number of native plant species and the total percentage of soil carbon. At landscape and biome scales, exotic species primarily invaded areas of high species richness in the four Central Grasslands sites and in the five Colorado Rockies vegetation types. For the nine vegetation types in both biomes, exotic species cover was positively correlated with mean foliar cover, mean soil percentage N, and the total number of exotic species. These patterns of invasibility depend on spatial scale, biome and vegetation type, spatial autocorrelation effects, availability of resources, and species-specific responses to grazing and other disturbances. We conclude that: (1) sites high in herbaceous foliar cover and soil fertility, and hot spots of plant diversity land biodiversity), are invasible in many landscapes; and (2) this pattern may be more closely related to the degree resources are available in native plant communities, independent of species richness. Exotic plant invasions in rare habitats and distinctive plant communities pose a significant challenge to land managers and conservation biologists."

Our specific objectives were to assess the temporal and spatial patterns of exotic plant species in a native grassland in Kansas (USA) and to determine the factors that control exotic species abundance and richness (i.e., invasibility). Exotic species (90% C3 plants) comprised approximately 10% of the flora, and their turnover was relatively high (30%) over the 15-year period. We found that disturbances significantly affected the abundance and richness of exotic species. In particular, long-term annually burned watersheds had lower cover of exotic species than unburned watersheds, and fire reduced exotic species richness by 80-90%. Exotic and native species richness were positively correlated across sites subjected to different fire (r = 0.72) and grazing (r = 0.67) treatments, and the number of exotic species was lowest on sites with the highest productivity of C4 grasses (i.e., high dominance). These results provide strong evidence for the role of community structure, as affected by disturbance, in determining invasibility of this grassland. Moreover, a significant positive relationship between exotic and native species richness was observed within a disturbance regime (annually burned sites, r = 0.51; unburned sites, r = 0.59). Thus, invasibility of this C4-dominated grassland can also be directly related to community structure independent of disturbance."

For several years, zebra mussels dominated molluscan biomass in the river; however, quagga mussels have increased in abundance and are apparently displacing zebra mussels from the Soulanges Canal, west of the Island of Montreal. The ratio of quagga mussel biomass to zebra mussel biomass on the canal wall is correlated with depth, and quagga mussels constitute > 99% of dreissenid biomass on bottom sediments. This dominance shift did not substantially affect the total dreissenid biomass, which has remained at 3 to 5 kg fresh mass /m(2) on the canal walls for nearly a decade. The mechanism for this shift is unknown, but may be related to a greater bioenergetic efficiency for quaggas, which attained larger shell sizes than zebra mussels at all depths. Similar events have occurred in the lower Great Lakes where zebra mussels once dominated littoral macroinvertebrate biomass, demonstrating that a well-established and prolific invader can be replaced by another introduced species without prior extinction."

Eighty-four forest stands were sampled and species composition and mean percent cover analyzed using ordination methods. Results showed that exotic tree/shrub types were of the most concern for invasion to urban boreal forests and that exotic species type, native habitat and propagule supply may be good indicators of invasive potential. Native forest structure appeared to confer a level of resistance to exotic species and medium to high disturbance intensity was associated with exotic species growth and spread without a corresponding loss in native species richness. Results provided large-scale evidence that diverse communities are less vulnerable to exotic species invasion, and that intermediate disturbance intensity supports species coexistence. From a management perspective, the retention of native species and native forest structure in urban forests is favored to minimize the impact of exotic species introductions, protect natural succession patterns, and minimize the spread of exotic species."

Weevil egg load was measured on native thistles in three landscape types: (1) agriculture dominated, (2) grassland dominated with exotic thistles, and, (3) grassland dominated without exotic thistles. We found no difference in egg load on native thistles within grassland landscapes without exotic thistles vs. within agricultural landscapes, suggesting that agricultural intensification per se does not influence levels of weevil attack. However, attack on the native Cirsium undulatum increased significantly (three- to fivefold) with increasing exotic thistle density. Within-patch exotic thistle density explained >50% of the variation in both the intensity and frequency of weevil attack. Since R. conicus feeding dramatically reduces seed production, exotic thistles likely exert a negative indirect effect on native thistles. This study provides some of the first empirical evidence that invasion by an exotic plant can increase attack of native plants by shared insect herbivores."

By only using experimentally established monocultures, rather than manipulating the abundance of particular functional groups, we removed both species diversity and differences in underlying abiotic conditions as potentially confounding variables. 3 We found that legume monocultures were more resistant than monocultures of grasses or non-leguminous forbs to invasion by sown legumes but not to invasion by other unsown species. The functional group effect remained after controlling for differences in total biomass and the average height of the above-ground biomass. 4 The relative success of legume species and types also varied with monoculture characteristics. The proportional biomass of climbing legumes increased strongly with biomass height in non-leguminous forb monocultures, while it declined with biomass height in grass monocultures. Trifolium pratense was the most successful invader in grass monocultures, while Vicia cracca was the most successful in non-leguminous forb monocultures. 5 Our results suggest that non-random assembly rules operate in grassland communities both between and within functional groups. Legume invaders found it much more difficult to invade legume plots, while grass and non-leguminous forb plots favoured non-climbing and climbing legumes, respectively. If plots mimic monospecific patches, the effect of these assembly rules in diverse communities might depend upon the patch structure of diverse communities. This dependency on patch structure may contribute to differences in results of research from experimental vs. natural communities."

We studied such processes in several generations of pink salmon Oncorhynchus gorbuscha introduced to the European North of Russia using a set of morphological and life-history traits as well as molecular genetic markers with different selective values: protein-coding loci, mtDNA, microsatellites, and MHC. The introduction of reproductively isolated pink salmon broodlines of odd and even years yielded different results. The odd-year broodline established self-reproducing local populations in many rivers of new range, but sustainable changes in external morphology, reproduction, and life-history, as well as the impoverishment of the gene pool occurred. Their successful colonisation of the new range resulted in specialisation manifested in the rapid directional shifts in some highly heritable phenotypic traits accompanied by increased homozygosity at molecular markers as a consequence of genetic drift and selective processes. The returns of transplanted pink salmon of even-year broodline decreased sharply already in the second generation, but there was no marked reduction of genetic diversity. Our data, as well as the analysis of the history of all pink salmon transplantations beyond the species range, demonstrate comparatively greater success of introduced odd-year broodline and permit to assume different adaptive plasticity of the even- and odd-year broodlines in pink salmon, what is most likely determined by differences in their evolutionary histories. Population genetic data suggest that the even-year broodline probably diverged from the odd-year broodline relatively recently and, due to the founder effect, may have lost a part of its genetic variation with which adaptive plasticity potential is associated."

We asked whether facultative food-for-protection mutualism between resident, nectar-feeding ants and extrafloral nectar-bearing plants confers biotic resistance to invasion by a specialist herbivore. Our research focused on the South American cactus-feeding moth Cactoblastis cactorum Berg (Lepidopetra: Pyralidae) in the panhandle region of Florida. This species has been widely and intentionally redistributed as a biological control agent against weedy cacti (Opuntia spp.) but arrived unintentionally in the southeast US, where it attacks native, non-target cacti and is considered a noxious invader. The acquired host-plants of C. cactorum in Florida secrete extrafloral nectar, especially on young, vegetative structures, and this attracts ants. We conducted ant-exclusion experiments over 2 years (2008 and 2009) at two sites using potted plants of two vulnerable host species (O. stricta and O. ficus-indica) to evaluate the influence of cactus-visiting ants (total of eight species) at multiple points in the moth life cycle (oviposition, egg survival, and larval survival). We found that the presence of ants often increased the mortality of lab-reared C. cactorum eggsticks (stacks of cohered eggs) and larvae that we introduced onto plants in the field, although these effects were variable across sites, years, host-plant species, ant species, and/or between old and young plant structures. In contrast to these ""staged"" encounters, we found that ants had little influence on the survival of cactus moths that occurred naturally at our field sites, or on moth damage and plant growth. In total, our experimental results suggest that the influence of cactus-visiting ants on C. cactorum invasion dynamics is weak and highly variable."

Hogs may impact forest regeneration dynamics through both direct effects, such as consumption of seeds, or indirectly via changes in disturbance frequency or intensity. Because they incorporate litter and live plant material into the soil, hogs may also influence ground cover and soil nutrient concentrations. We investigated the impacts of exotic feral hogs in a mixed pine-hardwood forest in the Big Thicket National Preserve (Texas. USA) where they are abundant. We established sixteen 10 m x 10 m plots and fenced eight of them to exclude feral hogs for 7 years. Excluding hogs increased the diversity of woody plants in the understory. Large seeded (>250 mg) species known to be preferred forage of feral hogs all responded positively to hog exclusion, thus consumption of Carya (hickory nuts), Quercus (acorns), and Nyssa seeds (tupelo) by hogs may be causing this pattern. The only exotic woody species, Sapium sebiferum (Chinese tallow tree), was more than twice as abundant with hogs present, perhaps as a response to increased disturbance. Hogs increased the amount of bare soil by decreasing the amounts of plant cover and surface litter. Plots with hogs present had lower soil ON, possibly due to accelerated rates of nitrogen mineralization. These results demonstrate that hogs may influence future overstory composition and reduce tree diversity in this forest. Management of hogs may be desirable in this and other forests where large-seeded species are an important component of the ecosystem. Further, by accelerating litter breakdown and elevating nitrogen in the soil, hogs have the potential to impact local vegetation composition via nitrogen inputs as well. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Experiments show that one-way facilitation favours exotic species and observational studies suggest that reciprocal facilitation among exotic species may lead to an invasional meltdown. We conducted a mesocosm experiment to determine whether reciprocal facilitation occurs in wetland communities. We established communities with native wetland plants and aquatic snails. Communities were assigned to treatments: control (only natives), exotic snail (Pomacea maculata) invasion, exotic plant (Alternanthera philoxeroides) invasion, sequential invasion (snails then plants or plants then snails) or simultaneous invasion (snails and plants). Pomacea maculata preferentially consumed native plants, so A. philoxeroides comprised a larger percentage of plant mass and native plant mass was lowest in sequential (snail then plant) invasion treatments. Even though P. maculata may indirectly facilitate A. philoxeroides, A. philoxeroides did not reciprocally facilitate P. maculata. Rather, ecosystems invaded by multiple exotic species may be affected by one-way facilitation or reflect exotic species' common responses to abiotic factors or common paths of introduction."

Such interactions are generally thought to enhance invasives' spread and impact (i.e., the ""invasional meltdown'' hypothesis); however, exotic species might also act indirectly to slow the spread or blunt the impact of other invasives. On the east coast of the United States, the invasive hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae, HWA) and elongate hemlock scale (Fiorinia externa, EHS) both feed on eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis). Of the two insects, HWA is considered far more damaging and disproportionately responsible for hemlock mortality. We describe research assessing the interaction between HWA and EHS, and the consequences of this interaction for eastern hemlock. We conducted an experiment in which uninfested hemlock branches were experimentally infested with herbivores in a 2 x 2 factorial design ( either, both, or neither herbivore species). Over the 2.5-year course of the experiment, each herbivore's density was; similar to 30% lower in mixed- vs. single-species treatments. Intriguingly, however, interspecific competition weakened rather than enhanced plant damage: growth was lower in the HWA-only treatment than in the HWA+EHS, EHS-only, or control treatments. Our results suggest that, for HWA-infested hemlocks, the benefit of co-occurring EHS infestations (reduced HWA density) may outweigh the cost (increased resource depletion)."

Furthermore, performance data are infrequently linked with variation in key environmental factors experienced by populations in each range, making it difficult to assess which factors are typically associated with shifts in performance. Here we assessed performance in native and introduced populations of Verbascum thapsus (common mullein), an herbaceous biennial that was initially introduced to the eastern US from Europe, but which has subsequently expanded its range into semi-arid mountainous regions of the western US, where it appears to be more problematic.

In contrast, controlling for abiotic factors reversed the pattern for plant area such that plants in introduced populations performed less well than natives. These results suggest that the difference in climate experienced by native and introduced populations is an important driver of mullein performance only for plant area. Thus, increased performance in western US population likely hinges in part on shifts in biotic factors. Indeed, we found a reduction in the prevalence of several herbivore guilds on introduced relative to native mullein, accompanied by a significant decrease in chewing damage in introduced populations. We also found differences in the potential for competition: cover of vegetation is significantly higher in native mullein populations than in introduced populations, and increasing cover of vegetation is associated with declining performance (i.e., density) of native populations but not introduced populations. In sum, the introduced populations performed better than the native populations in several respects; thus, although mullein is considered a relatively 'benign' introduced species, it has the potential to differentially impact resident communities in its native and introduced ranges.

This may reflect shared responses to a common factor, but may also reflect positive interactions among these exotic species. Armand Bayou (Pasadena, TX) is one such ecosystem where multiple species of invasive aquatic plants are common. We used this system to investigate whether presence of one exotic species made subsequent invasions by other exotic species more likely, less likely, or if it had no effect. We performed an experiment in which we selectively removed exotic rooted and/or floating aquatic plant species and tracked subsequent colonization and growth of native and invasive species. This allowed us to quantify how presence or absence of one plant functional group influenced the likelihood of successful invasion by members of the other functional group. We found that presence of alligatorweed (rooted plant) decreased establishment of new water hyacinth (free-floating plant) patches but increased growth of hyacinth in established patches, with an overall net positive effect on success of water hyacinth. Water hyacinth presence had no effect on establishment of alligatorweed but decreased growth of existing alligatorweed patches, with an overall net negative effect on success of alligatorweed. Moreover, observational data showed positive correlations between hyacinth and alligatorweed with hyacinth, on average, more abundant. The negative effect of hyacinth on alligatorweed growth implies competition, not strong mutual facilitation (invasional meltdown), is occurring in this system. Removal of hyacinth may increase alligatorweed invasion through release from competition. However, removal of alligatorweed may have more complex effects on hyacinth patch dynamics because there were strong opposing effects on establishment versus growth. The mix of positive and negative interactions between floating and rooted aquatic plants may influence local population dynamics of each group and thus overall invasion pressure in this watershed."

Is there any post-dispersal positive effect of the exotic shrub Pyracantha angustifolia on the success of Ligustrum lucidum seedlings, as compared to the effect of the native Condalia montana or the open herbaceous patches between shrubs? 2. Is the possible facilitation by Pyracantha and/or Condalia related to differential emergence, growth, or survival of Ligustrum seedlings under their canopies? Location: Cordoba, central Argentina. Methods: We designed three treatments. in which ten mature individuals of Pvracantha, ten of the dominant native shrub Condalia montana, and ten patches without shrub cover were involved. In each treatment we planted seeds and saplings of Ligustrum collected from nearby natural populations. Seedlings emerging from the planted seeds were harvested after one year to measure growth. Survival of the transplanted saplings was recorded every two month during a year. Half of the planted seeds and transplanted saplings were cage-protected from rodents. Results: Ligustrum seedling emergence did not differ among treatments while growth was significantly higher in the absence of shrub cover. Sapling survival was significantly higher under the canopy of Pyracantha, intermediate under Condalia. and lowest in the absence of shrub cover. Caging did not affect Growth but enhanced seedling emergence and sapling survival. Conclusion: The differential sapling survival in the shrub canopy treatments is consistent with natural sapling distribution. Pyracantha and, less so, Condalia, has a nurse-plant effect on Ligustrum. This results from contrasting effects of the shrubs on different stages of the life cycle of Ligustrum: no effect on seedling emergence, negative on seedling growth, and positive on sapling survival. This suggests that efforts to control the expansion of Ligustrum over the landscape should tackle Pvracantha as well."

We censused 20 x 20 m plots for vegetation cover and environmental characteristics in the center of twenty randomly-selected Robinia pseudoacacia stands. Additionally, paired plots were surveyed under native overstory stands, comprised largely of pitch pine (Pinus rigida) and mixed pitch pine-oak (Quercus velutina and Quercus alba) communities. These native stands were located 20 m from the edge of the sampled locust stand and had similar land use histories. To determine the historical distribution of black locust in CCNS, we digitized and georeferenced historical and current aerial photographs of randomly-selected stands. Ordination analyses revealed striking community-level differences between locust and pine-oak stands in their immediate vicinity. Understory nonnative species richness and abundance values were significantly higher under Robinia stands than under the paired native stands. Additionally, animal-dispersed plant species tended to occur in closer stands, suggesting their spread between locust stands. Robinia stand area significantly decreased from the 1970's to 2002, prompting us to recommend no management action of black locust and a monitoring program and possible removal of associated animal-dispersed species. The introduction of a novel functional type (nitrogen-fixing tree) into this xeric, nutrient-poor, upland forested ecosystem resulted in 'islands of invasion' within this resistant system."

The occurrence of abundant native macro-algal species such as Polysiphonia nigrescens, Antithamnion plumula and Elachista fucicola decreased with increasing S. muticum densities. Sessile invertebrates, by contrast, were only marginally affected and we found no effects of S. muticum canopy on diversity and abundance of endofauna organisms. We conclude that increasing densities of S. muticum on C gigas beds in the shallow subtidal zone of the Wadden Sea limit the occurrence of native macroalgae which otherwise would benefit from the additional hard substratum provided by the oysters. Thus, a secondary invader may abolish the effects of the primary invader for native species by occupying the new formed niche. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

We examined the potential for endozoochoric dispersal of native and exotic plants by exotic hog deer (Axis porcinus) in south-eastern Australia. We quantified the germinable seed content of hog deer faecal pellets collected in five vegetation types within a 10,500-ha study area that was representative of their Australian range. Twenty exotic and 22 native species germinated from hog deer faecal pellets and significantly more native species germinated compared to exotic species. Seedlings of the encroaching native shrub Acacia longifolia var. sophorae emerged, but no native trees emerged and the percentage of grasses that germinated was low (11%). The species composition of germinants was similar among the five vegetation types. We estimated that the hog deer population in our study area could potentially disperse > 130,000 viable seeds daily. Our study shows how an exotic mammal can disperse seeds from both native and invasive plants and highlights the need for endozoochory to be considered more widely in studies assessing the impacts of exotic mammals on plant communities."

Determining the causes of invasion's, however, can be difficult, owing to the complexity and spatio-temporal heterogeneity of the invasion process. The purpose of this study was to assess factors influencing rate of invasion for the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile), a widespread invasive species. The rate of invasion for 20 independent Argentine ant populations was measured over 4 years in riparian woodlands in the lower Sacramento River Valley of northern California. A priori predictors of rate of invasion included stream flow (a measure of abiotic suitability), disturbance, and native ant richness. In addition, baits were used to estimate the abundance of Argentine ants and native ants at the 20 sites. A multiple regression model accounted for nearly half of the variation in mean rate of invasion (R-2 = 0.46)? but stream flow was the only significant factor in this analysis. Argentine ants spread, on average, 16 m year(-1) at sites with permanent stream flow and retreated, on average, -6 m year(-1) at sites with intermittent stream flow. Rate of invasion was independent of both disturbance and native ant richness. Argentine ants recruited to more baits in higher numbers in invaded areas than did native ants in uninvaded areas. In addition, rate of invasion was positively correlated with the proportion of baits recruited to by native ants in uninvaded areas. Together, these findings suggest that abiotic suitability is of paramount importance in determining rate of invasion for the Argentine ant."

After fire, it is partially replaced by Melinis minutiflora, another invasive C-4 grass. Seed bank surveys in unburned woodland showed that Melinis seed is present in locations without adult plants. Using a combination of germination tests and seedling outplant experiments, we tested the hypothesis that Melinis was unable to invade the unburned woodland because of nutrient and/or light limitation. We found that Melinis germination and seedling growth are depressed by the low light levels common under Schizachyrium in unburned woodland. Outplanted Melinis seedlings grew rapidly to flowering and persisted for several years in unburned woodland without nutrient additions, but only if Schizachyrium individuals were removed. Nutrients alone did not facilitate Melinis establishment. Competition between Melinis and Schizachyrium naturally occurs when individuals of both species emerge from the seed bank simultaneously, or when seedlings of one species emerge in sites already dominated by individuals of the other species. When both species are grown from seed, we found that Melinis consistently outcompetes Schizachyrium, regardless of light or nutrient treatments. When seeds of Melinis were added to pots with well-established Schizachyrium (and vice versa), Melinis eventually invaded and overgrew adult Schizachyrium under high, but not low, nutrients. By contrast, Schizachyrium could not invade established Melinis pots regardless of nutrient level. A field experiment demonstrated that Schizachyrium individuals are suppressed by Melinis in burned sites through competition for both light and nutrients. Overall, Melinis is a dominant competitor over Schizachyrium once it becomes established, whether in a pot or in the field. We believe that the dominance of Schizachyrium, rather than Melinis, in the unburned woodland is the result of asymmetric competition due to the prior establishment of Schizachyrium in these sites. If Schizachyrium were not present, the unburned woodland could support dense stands of Melinis. Fire disrupts the priority effect of Schizachyrium and allows the dominant competitor (Melinis) to enter the system where it eventually replaces Schizachyrium through resource competition."

Freshwaters are subject to particularly high rates of species introductions; hence, invaders increasingly co-occur and may interact to enhance impacts on ecosystem structure and function. As trophic interactions are a key mechanism by which invaders influence communities, we used a combination of approaches to investigate the feeding preferences and community impacts of two globally invasive large benthic decapods that co-occur in freshwaters: the signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) and Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis). 2. In laboratory preference tests, both consumed similar food items, including chironomids, isopods and the eggs of two coarse fish species. In a comparison of predatory functional responses with a native crayfish (Austropotamobius pallipes), juvenile E. sinensis had a greater predatory intensity than the native A. pallipes on the keystone shredder Gammarus pulex, and also displayed a greater preference than P. leniusculus for this prey item. 3. In outdoor mesocosms (n = 16) used to investigate community impacts, the abundance of amphipods, isopods, chironomids and gastropods declined in the presence of decapods, and a decapod > gastropod > periphyton trophic cascade was detected when both species were present. Eriocheir sinensis affected a wider range of animal taxa than P. leniusculus. 4. Stable-isotope and gut-content analysis of wild-caught adult specimens of both invaders revealed a wide and overlapping range of diet items including macrophytes, algae, terrestrial detritus, macroinvertebrates and fish. Both decapods were similarly enriched in N-15 and occupied the same trophic level as Ephemeroptera, Odonata and Notonecta. Eriocheir sinensis delta C-13 values were closely aligned with macrophytes indicating a reliance on energy from this basal resource, supported by evidence of direct consumption from gut contents. Pacifastacus leniusculus delta C-13 values were intermediate between those of terrestrial leaf litter and macrophytes, suggesting reliance on both allochthonous and autochthonous energy pathways. 5. Our results suggest that E. sinensis is likely to exert a greater per capita impact on the macroinvertebrate communities in invaded systems than P. leniusculus, with potential indirect effects on productivity and energy flow through the community."

The stomach-content analysis showed that P. clarkii is a polytrophic omnivore that feeds on. macrophytes, detritus and macroinvertebrates. The trophic diversity of its diet was highest in mid-summer and in smaller crayfish. Chironomidae larvae and Dreissena polymorpha were the most preferred prey, whereas sediment-dwelling taxa were rarely consumed. The number of consumed small and agile prey negatively correlated with the crayfish size, suggesting an ontogenetic shift in diet. A five-week enclosure experiment was used to determine the impact of P. clarkii on the basal levels of a typical littoral food web of cold lakes at different crayfish densities (0, 2.5, and 5 crayfish m(-2)). The abundance of aquatic snails sharply decreased with increasing crayfish density and conditioned leaf breakdown was up to five times higher in the presence of crayfish than in the control treatment without crayfish. Crayfish also had a negative effect on macrophyte biomass, resulting from both consumption and uprooting. However, the impact mechanisms and outcomes differed among macrophyte species. In the crayfish treatments, the final biomass of the indigenous Myriophyllum spicatum and Chara sp. was significantly reduced relative to the initially stocked biomass, whereas the alien Elodea nuttallii was able to gain biomass. This finding is consistent with an invasional meltdown scenario, in that P. clarkii indirectly facilitated a dominance of E. nuttallii. Overall, the results concordantly suggest that P. clarkii is a keystone species that can profoundly alter recipient communities via direct trophic links and non-consumptive destruction, and may indirectly facilitate other invasive alien species.

When an invasive predator encounters native and invasive prey, two scenarios are possible: the predator may benefit from the presence of naive native prey or choose prey from its region of origin, reflecting their common evolutionary history. 2. To determine interactions between an invasive predator and native and invasive prey, we used the Ponto-Caspian racer goby Babka gymnotrachelus as predator and gammarids as prey: native Gammarus fossarum and Ponto-Caspian Dikerogammarus villosus and Pontogammarus robustoides. We hypothesised that prey origin would affect fish preferences and growth rate and conducted a series of laboratory experiments on fish predation and growth and estimated profitability of prey of different origin. 3. The goby preferred native prey to the Ponto-Caspian gammarids, irrespective of prey motility, the presence of shelters or waterborne chemical cues. Moreover, fish grew better when fed native prey. 4. Thus, we suggest that fish selectivity was based on the assessment of prey quality during direct contact with gammarids. A diet consisting of Ponto-Caspian gammarids did not facilitate an invader originating from the same region, which benefited more from the presence of a local prey species. 5. Ponto-Caspian gammarids and gobies are successful invaders in inland waters, usually main rivers. The gobies, in contrast to the invasive gammarids, enter smaller tributaries that serve as refugia for native gammarids. We show that the gobies may benefit from the presence of native prey species in such locations."

The other half has been widely overgrazed and transformed into savannah and prairie-like open habitats that exhibit sheet and gully erosion and are covered by a mix of native and alien invasive vegetation today. Vegetation transects in this moderately sheep-impacted sector show that a significant number of native and endemic herb and shrub species exhibit sympatric distribution patterns with introduced plants. Only one alien plant species has been recorded from any undisturbed and sheep-free island sector so far. Socorro Island provides support for the hypothesis that disturbance of a pristine ecosystem is generally required for the colonization and naturalization of alien plants.

The use of off-season burns to control exotic vegetation shows promise for land managers. In California, wildfires tend to occur in the summer and autumn, when most grassland vegetation is dormant. The effects of spring fires on native bunchgrasses have been examined but their impacts on native forbs have received less attention. 2. We introduced Erodium macrophyllum, a rare native annual forb, by seeding plots in 10 different areas in a California grassland. We tested the hypotheses that E. macrophyllum would perform better (increased fecundity and germination) when competing with native grasses than with a mixture of exotic and native grasses, and fire would alter subsequent demography of E. macrophyllum and other species' abundances. We monitored the demography of E. macrophyllum for two seasons in plots manually weeded so that they were free from exotics, and in areas that were burned or not burned the spring after seeding. 3. Weeding increased E. macrophyllum seedling emergence, survival and fecundity during both seasons. When vegetation was burned in June 2001 (at the end of the first growing season) to kill exotic grass seeds before they dispersed, all E. macrophyllum plants had finished their life cycle and dispersed seeds, suggesting that burns at this time of year would not directly impact on fecundity. In the growing season after burning (2002), burned plots had less recruitment of E. macrophyllum but more establishment of native grass seedlings, suggesting burning may differentially affect seedling recruitment. 4. At the end of the second growing season (June 2002), burned plots had less cover of exotic and native grasses but more cover of exotic forbs. Nevertheless, E. macrophyllum plants in burned plots had greater fecundity than in non-burned plots, suggesting that exotic grasses are more competitive than exotic forbs. 5. A glasshouse study showed that exotic grasses competitively suppress E. macrophyllum to a greater extent than native grasses, indicating that the poor performance of E. macrophyllum in the non-burned plots was due to exotic grass competition. 6. Synthesis and applications. This study illustrates that fire can alter the competitive environment in grasslands with differential effects on rare forbs, and that exotic grasses strongly interfere with E. macrophyllum. For land managers, the benefits of prescribed spring burns will probably outweigh the costs of decreased E. macrophyllum establishment. Land managers can use spring burns to cause a flush of native grass recruitment and to create an environment that is, although abundant with exotic forbs, ultimately less competitive compared with non-burned areas dominated by exotic grasses."

Total species richness, alien species richness, and alien cover declined with elevation, at scales from 1 to 1000 m(2). We found no support for the hypothesis that community diversity inhibits alien invasion. At the 1-m(2) point scale, where we would expect competitive interactions between the largely herbaceous flora to be most intense, alien species richness as well as alien cover increased with increasing native species richness in all communities. This suggests that aliens are limited not by the number of native competitors, but by resources that affect establishment of both natives and aliens. Blue-oak savannas were heavily dominated by alien species and consistently had more alien than native species at the 1-m(2) scale. All of these aliens are annuals, and it is widely thought that they have displaced native bunchgrasses. If true, this means that aliens have greatly increased species richness. Alternatively, there is a rich regional flora of native annual forbs that could have dominated these grasslands prior to displacement by alien grasses. On our sites, livestock grazing increased the number of alien species and alien cover only slightly over that of sites free of livestock grazing for more than a century, indicating some level of permanency to this invasion. In chaparral,,both diversity and aliens increased markedly several years after fire. Invasive species are rare in undisturbed shrublands, and alien propagules fail to survive the natural crown fires in these ecosystems. Thus, aliens necessarily must colonize after fire and, as a consequence, time since fire is an important determinant of invasive presence.

We compared how a wildfire affected plant diversity in chaparral vegetation on serpentine and sandstone soils. We hypothesized that because biomass and cover are lower in serpentine chaparral, space and light are less limiting, and therefore postfire increases in plant species diversity would be lower than in sandstone chaparral. In 40 pairs of burned and unburned 250-m(2) plots, we measured changes in the plant community after a fire for three years. The diversity of native and exotic species increased more in response to fire in sandstone than serpentine chaparral, at both the local (plot) and regional (whole study) scales. In serpentine compared with sandstone chaparral, specialized fire-dependent species were less prevalent, mean fire Severity was lower, mean time since last fire was longer, postfire shrub recruitment was lower, and regrowth of biomass was slower. Within each chaparral type, the responses of diversity to fire were positively correlated with prefire shrub cover and with a number of measures of soil fertility. Fire severity was negatively related to the postfire change in diversity in sandstone chaparral, and unimodally related to the postfire change in diversity in serpentine chaparral. Our results suggest that the effects of fire on less productive plant communities like serpentine chaparral may be less pronounced, although longer lasting, than the effects of fire on similar but more productive communities."

Invasions are, however, multi-phase processes with at least two phases, dispersal and introduction, that occur before establishment. Characteristics that enhance survival at any of these three phases will contribute to invasion success. Here, we synthesize information on the dispersal, introduction, and establishment of fishes mediated by ship ballast-water transport. We synthesize 54 reports of at least 31 fish species collected from ballast tanks (Phase 1), including 28 new reports from our recent studies (1986 to 1996), Our literature survey revealed 40 reports of 32 fish species whose introductions have been attributed to ballast transport (Phase 2), of which at least 24 survived to establish persistent populations (Phase 3). We detected little overlap at the species level between these two data sets (Phase 1 vs Phases 2 and 3), but patterns emerged at the family level, The Gobiidae (6 species), Clupeidae (4 species), and Gasterostcidae (1 species) were the most commonly found fish families in ballast tanks (Phase 1). The Gobiidae (13 species), Blenniidae (6 species) and Pleuronectidae (2 species) dominated the list of ballast-mediated introductions (Phase 2); gobies and blennies were the families most frequently established (Phase 3). The invasive success of gobies and blennies may be explained in part by their crevicolous nature: both groups seek refuge and lay eggs in small holes, and may take advantage of the ballast-intake holes on ship hulls. This behavior, not typically associated with invasive ability, may contribute to successful introduction and establishment by facilitating the dispersal phase of invasion. The failure of the pleuronectids to invade may reflect poor salinity match between donor and recipient regions. To develop a predictive framework of invasion success, organisms must be sampled at all three phases of the invasion process. Our comparison of two ballast sampling methods suggests that fishes have been undersampled in ballast-water studies, including our own, and that the role of ballast transport in promoting fish invasions has been underestimated."

Three major hypotheses, which are not necessarily mutually exclusive, have been proposed to explain the establishment of non- native species: the '' human activity '' hypothesis, which argues that human activities facilitate the establishment of non- native species by disturbing natural landscapes and by increasing propagule pressure; the '' biotic resistance '' hypothesis, predicting that species- rich communities will readily impede the establishment of non- native species; and the '' biotic acceptance '' hypothesis, predicting that environmentally suitable habitats for native species are also suitable for non- native species. We tested these hypotheses and report here a global map of fish invasions ( i. e., the number of non- native fish species established per river basin) using an original worldwide dataset of freshwater fish occurrences, environmental variables, and human activity indicators for 1,055 river basins covering more than 80% of Earth's surface. First, we identified six major invasion hotspots where non- native species represent more than a quarter of the total number of species. According to the World Conservation Union, these areas are also characterised by the highest proportion of threatened fish species. Second, we show that the human activity indicators account for most of the global variation in non- native species richness, which is highly consistent with the '' human activity '' hypothesis. In contrast, our results do not provide support for either the '' biotic acceptance '' or the '' biotic resistance '' hypothesis. We show that the biogeography of fish invasions matches the geography of human impact at the global scale, which means that natural processes are blurred by human activities in driving fish invasions in the world's river systems. In view of our findings, we fear massive invasions in developing countries with a growing economy as already experienced in developed countries. Anticipating such potential biodiversity threats should therefore be a priority."

We quantify phylogenetic clustering and overdispersion of native and non-native fishes of a large river basin in the American Southwest to test for the mechanisms (environmental filtering versus competitive exclusion) and spatial scales influencing community structure. Contrary to expectations, non-native species were phylogenetically clustered and related to natural environmental conditions, whereas native species were not phylogenetically structured, likely reflecting human-related changes to the basin. The species that are most invasive (in terms of ecological impacts) tended to be the most phylogenetically divergent from natives across watersheds, but not within watersheds, supporting the hypothesis that Darwin's naturalization conundrum is driven by the spatial scale. Phylogenetic distinctiveness may facilitate non-native establishment at regional scales, but environmental filtering restricts local membership to closely related species with physiological tolerances for current environments. By contrast, native species may have been phylogenetically clustered in historical times, but species loss from contemporary populations by anthropogenic activities has likely shaped the phylogenetic signal. Our study implies that fundamental mechanisms of community assembly have changed, with fundamental consequences for the biogeography of both native and non-native species."

However, much remains uncertain about the types of ecological processes and community attributes that contribute to biotic resistance. We used experimental mesocosms to examine how zooplankton community structure, invertebrate predation, and nutrient supply jointly affected the establishment of the exotic Daphnia lumholtzi. We predicted that establishment would increase with declining biomass and diversity of native zooplankton communities and that an invertebrate predator (IP) would indirectly facilitate the establishment of D. lumholtzi due to its relatively long predator-deterring spines. Furthermore, we hypothesized that elevated nutrient supply would increase algal food availability and facilitate establishment. Only when the biomass and diversity of native zooplankton were significantly reduced, was D.lumholtzi able to successfully invade mesocosms. Although invertebrate predation and resource supply modified attributes of native zooplankton communities, they did not influence the establishment of D. lumholtzi. Overall, ourresults are consistent with observed population dynamics in invaded reservoirs where D.lumholtzi tends to be present only during the late summer, coinciding with historic mid-summer declines in native zooplankton populations. Lakes and reservoirs may be more susceptible to invasion not only by D. lumholtzi, but also by other planktonic species, in the late summer when native communities exhibit characteristics associated with lower levels of biotic resistance."

We studied the potential role played by V. germanica on the subsequent invasion process of V. vulgaris wasps in Patagonia by focusing on the foraging interaction between both species. This is because food searching and exploitation are likely to overlap strongly among Vespula wasps. We carried out choice tests where two types of baits were presented in a pairwise manner. We found experimental evidence supporting the hypothesis that V. germanica and V. vulgaris have an asymmetrical response to baits with stimuli simulating the presence of each other. V. germanica avoided baits with either visual or olfactory cues indicating the V. vulgaris presence. However, V. vulgaris showed no preference between baits with or lacking V. germanica stimuli. These results suggest that the presence of an established population of V. germanica may not contribute to added biotic resistance to V. vulgaris invasion."

This is consistent with the notion of closed-canopy forests as communities relatively resistant to plant invasions. However, alien plants able to develop shade tolerance could be a threat to this unique forest. Phenotypic plasticity and local adaptation are two mechanisms enhancing invasiveness. Phenotypic plasticity can promote local adaptation by facilitating the establishment and persistence of invasive species in novel environments. We investigated the role of these processes in the recent colonization of Valdivian forest understory by the perennial alien herb Prunella vulgaris from nearby populations in open sites. Using reciprocal transplants, we found local adaptation between populations. Field data showed that the shade environment selected for taller plants and greater specific leaf areas. We found population differentiation and within-population genetic variation in both mean values and reaction norms to light variation of several ecophysiological traits in common gardens from seeds collected in sun and shade populations. The colonization of the forest resulted in a reduction of plastic responses to light variation, which is consistent with the occurrence of genetic assimilation and suggests that P. vulgaris individuals adapted to the shade have reduced probabilities to return to open sites. All results taken together confirm the potential for rapid evolution of shade tolerance in P. vulgaris and suggest that this alien species may pose a threat to the native understory flora of Valdivian forest.

We translocated mated female waterstriders, Aquarius najas, into 90 streams that were not currently inhabited by the species. We manipulated sizes of propagules (from 2 to 16 mated females) and numbers of origin populations (one or two). Three origin populations were genetically different from each other, but they were less than 150 km from the streams of translocation. The results demonstrate clearly that both the larger propagule size and the high number of source populations have positive effects on the probability of colonizing a new stream.

Eleven have been classified as invasive, but only four are managed yet, mainly by weed cutting. Most of the alien aquatic plant species were probably introduced as aquarium and pond waste. Despite this fact, 18 of the 27 known alien species are traded as ornamentals for aquaria or garden ponds in German shops. Alien species can most successfully be controlled when their management starts as soon as possible after their introduction. In Germany, the delay between first records and start of management actions seems too long for successful control. The public awareness of alien aquatic plants and problems they can cause in Germany is still limited despite a number of recent projects. At present, Black lists are developed that help nature conservationists, stakeholders and politicians to select those alien species for which prevention measures should be implemented.

Reproductive and establishment traits are considered key features of a population expansion process, but few works have studied many of these simultaneously. This work examines how large the differences are in reproductive and establishment traits between two Fabaceae, the exotic invasive, Gleditsia triacanthos and the native, Acacia aroma. Gleditsia is a serious leguminous woody invader in various parts of the world and Acacia is a common native tree of Argentina. Both species have similar dispersal mechanisms and their reproductive phenology overlaps. We chose 17 plants of each species in a continuous forest of the Chaco Serrano Forest of Cordoba, Argentina. In each plant we measured fruit production, fruit removal (exclusion experiments), seed predation (pre- and post-dispersal), seed germination, seed bank (on each focal tree, three sampling periods during the year), and density of seedlings (around focal individuals and randomly in the study site). Gleditsia presented some traits that could favour the invasion process, such as a higher number of seeds per plant, percentage of scarified seed germination and density of seedlings around the focal individuals, than Acacia. On the other hand, Gleditsia presented a higher percentage of seed predation. The seed bank was persistent in both species and no differences were observed in fruit removal. This work highlights the importance of simultaneously studying reproductive and establishment variables involved in the spreading of an exotic invasive species. It also gives important insight into the variables to be considered when planning management strategies. The results are discussed from the perspective of some remarkable hypotheses on invasive species and may contribute to rethinking some aspects of the theory on invasive species.

Plant functional response to nutrient availability, and what this tells us about plant interactions with associated species, may therefore give us clues about underlying processes related to plant abundance and invasion. Patterns of abundance of Hieracium lepidulum, a European herbaceous invader of subalpine New Zealand, appear to be related to soil fertility/nutrient availability, however, abundance may be influenced by other factors including disturbance. In this study we compare H. lepidulum and field co-occurring species for growth performance across artificial nutrient concentration gradients, for relative competitiveness and for response to disturbance, to construct a functional profile of the species. Hieracium lepidulum was found to be significantly different in its functional response to nutrient concentration gradients. Hieracium lepidulum had high relative growth rate, high yield and root plasticity in response to nutrient concentration dilution, relatively low absolute yield, low competitive yield and a positive response to clipping disturbance relative to other species. Based on overall functional response to nutrient concentration gradients, compared with other species found at the same field sites, we hypothesize that H. lepidulum invasion is not related to competitive domination. Relatively low tolerance of nutrient dilution leads us to predict that H. lepidulum is likely to be restricted from invading low fertility sites, including sites within alpine vegetation or where intact high biomass plant communities are found. Positive response to clipping disturbance and relatively high nutrient requirement, despite poor competitive performance, leads us to predict that H. lepidulum may respond to selective grazing disturbance of associated vegetation. These results are discussed in relation to published observations of H. lepidulum in New Zealand and possible tests for the hypotheses raised here."

Although observed functional differences between alien and native plant species support the idea that invasions are favoured by niche differentiation (ND), when considering invasions along large ecological gradients, habitat filtering (HF) has been proposed to constrain alien species such that they exhibit similar trait values to natives. 2. To reconcile these contrasting observations, we used a multiscale approach using plant functional traits to evaluate how biotic interactions with native species and grazing might determine the functional structure of highly invaded grasslands along an elevation gradient in New Zealand. 3. At a regional scale, functional differences between alien and native plant species translated into nonrandom community assembly and high ND. Alien and native species showed contrast-ing responses to elevation and the degree of ND between them decreased as elevation increased, suggesting a role for HF. At the plant-neighbourhood scale, species with contrasting traits were generally spatially segregated, highlighting the impact of biotic interactions in struc-turing local plant communities. A confirmatory multilevel path analysis showed that the effect of elevation and grazing was moderated by the presence of native species, which in turn influ-enced the local abundance of alien species. 4. Our study showed that functional differences between aliens and natives are fundamental to understand the interplay between multiple mechanisms driving alien species success and their coexistence with natives. In particular, the success of alien species is driven by the pres-ence of native species which can have a negative (biotic resistance) or a positive (facilitation) effect depending on the functional identity of alien species."

Some invasive plant species are among the most widely distributed plants worldwide. Plasticity and local adaptation could be the mechanisms for colonising new areas. Aims: We addressed if Taraxacum officinale from native (Alps) and introduced (Andes) stock responded similarly to drought treatment, in terms of photosynthesis, foliar angle, and flowering time. We also evaluated if ontogeny affected fitness and physiological responses to drought. Methods: We carried out two common garden experiments with both seedlings and adults (F2) of T. officinale from its native and introduced ranges in order to evaluate their plasticity and ecotypic differentiation under a drought treatment. Results: Our data suggest that the functional response of T. officinale individuals from the introduced range to drought is the result of local adaptation rather than plasticity. In addition, the individuals from the native distribution range were more sensitive to drought than those from the introduced distribution ranges at both seedling and adult stages. Conclusions: These results suggest that local adaptation may be a possible mechanism underlying the successful invasion of T. officinale in high mountain environments of the Andes."

However, other mechanisms I did not investigate could have contributed to these two results. In this marine community the sequential preemption of key resources by different functional groups in different stages of the invasion generated resistance to invasion by S. muticum. Rather than acting collectively on a single resource the functional groups in this system were important for preempting either space or light, but not both resources. My experiment has important implications for diversity-invasibility studies, which typically look for an effect of diversity on individual resources. Overall invasion resistance will be due to the additive effects of individual functional groups (or species) summed over an invader's life cycle. Therefore, the cumulative effect of multiple functional groups (or species) acting on multiple resources is an alternative mechanism that could generate negative relationships between diversity and invasibility in a variety of biological systems."

Variation in functional community composition is expected to influence the extent of exotic species invasions. Yet, whether resident functional groups control invasion through their relative biomass (mass ratio hypothesis) or by traits other than biomass (identity hypothesis) remains poorly understood. 2. We performed a 6-year experiment to determine the effects of removing different functional groups on exotic species biomass in a Flooding Pampa grassland, Argentina. Functional groups were defined by life-form (grasses or forbs), phenology (winter or summer) and origin (native or exotic). Removal of each functional group was compared against the removal of an equivalent amount of random biomass. Exotic group responses were monitored over 4years of continuous removals, and after 2years of recovery without manipulations. 3. Removal of dominant native summer grasses caused the greatest impact on exotic species and overall community composition. Native summer-grass removal significantly increased exotic grass (120%) and forb (730%) biomass beyond the level (46% and 180%, respectively) expected from deleting a similar amount of biomass at random. Exotic annual grasses showed only a transient increase, whereas exotic forb invasion persisted even after 2years without removals. 4. Removing subordinate, native or exotic winter grasses, and rare native forbs significantly promoted exotic forbs, but to the same level (300%) as random biomass removals. Total grass removal increased exotic forbs to half the extent expected from adding the effects of single grass group removals. Dispersal limitation and harsh abiotic conditions may constrain exotic forb spread into such heavily grass-depleted patches. 5. Synthesis. The impact of losing a functional group on the magnitude and persistence of invasion reflected its relative contribution to community biomass. Identity attributes other than biomass (e.g. phenological niche) further enhanced the biotic control that dominant native grasses exerted on established exotic species. Our findings highlight the community legacies of past disturbances to dominant functional groups."

This study was designed to compare invasion resistance among communities with species functionally similar or dissimilar to yellow starthistle (Centaurea solstitialis), a late-season annual. A field experiment was conducted in the Central Valley of California with six experimental plant communities that included (1) six early-season native annual forbs (AF); (2) five late-season native perennials and one summer annual forb (NP); (3) a combination of three early-season native annual forbs and three late-season native perennials (FP); (4) six early-season non-native annual grasses (AG); (5) monoculture of the late-season native perennial grass Elymus glaucus (EG); and (6) monoculture of the late-season native perennial Grindelia camporum (GC). Following establishment, C. solstitialis seed was added to half of the plots, and a monoculture of C. solstitialis (CS) was established as a control. Over a 5-year period, the AF and AG communities were ineffective at preventing C. solstitialis invasion. Centaurea solstitialis cover remained less than 10% in the FP and NP communities, except in year 1. By the fourth year, E. glaucus cover was greater than 50% in NP and FP communities and had spread to all other communities (e.g., 27% cover in CS in year 5). Communities containing E. glaucus, which is functionally similar to C. solstitialis, better resisted invasion than communities lacking a functional analog. In contrast, G. camporum, which is also functionally similar to C. solstitialis, failed to survive. Consequently, species selection for restored communities must consider not only functional similarity to the invader but also establishment success, competitiveness, and survivorship."

The photosynthesis-nitrogen relationship was uniform across all three species, and the maximum light-saturated rate of photosynthesis expressed on a leaf area basis (Am) did not differ significantly between species. However, specific leaf area (SLA) in G. maxima (17 +/- 6 m(2) kg(-1)) was 1.3 times that of the sedges, leading to 1.4 times higher maximum rates of photosynthesis (350-400 nmol CO2 g(-1) dry mass s(-1)) expressed on a leaf mass basis (A(max)(m)) when N supply was unlimited, compared to the sedges (<300 nmol CO2 g(-1) dry mass s-1). Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) revealed significant positive relationships between leaf N content and chlorophyll a:b ratios, stomatal conductance (g(s)), dark respiration rate (R-d), and the photosynthetic light saturation point (I-k) in G. maxima, but not in the sedges. ANCOVA also identified that, compared to G. maxima, the sedges had 2.4 times higher intrinsic water use efficiency (A/g(s): range 20-70 cf. 8-30 mu mol CO2 mol(-1) H2O) and 1.6 times higher nitrogen use efficiency (NUE: 25-30 cf. 20-23 g dry mass g(-1) N) under excess N supply. Relative growth rates (RGR) were not significantly higher in G. maxima than the sedges, but correlations between leaf N, gas exchange parameters (A(max)(a), A(max)(m), R-d and g(s)) and RGR were all highly significant in G. maxima, whereas they were weak or absent in the sedges. Allocation of biomass (root:shoot ratio, leaf mass ratio, root mass ratio), plant N and P content, and allocation of N to leaves all showed significantly greater phenotypic plasticity and stronger correlation to final biomass in G. maxima than in the sedges. We therefore conclude that photosynthesis and growth rates are not intrinsically higher in this invader than in the native species with which it competes, but that its success under nutrient enrichment is a consequence of greater physiological responsiveness and growth plasticity, and stronger integration between gas exchange and growth, coupled with indifference to resource wastage (i.e. low WUE and NUE) at high nutrient supply. The poorer performance of G. maxima than the sedges under low nutrient supply supports the importance of nutrient management, especially N, as a strategy to minimise the invasive behaviour of fast-growing herbaceous species in wetlands.

Waddington termed this process ""genetic assimilation"" [1, 7]. Despite the potential importance of genetic assimilation to evolutionary changes in founder populations [8-10], empirical evidence on this topic is rare, possibly because it happens on short timescales and is therefore difficult to detect except under unusual circumstances [11,12]. We exploited a mosaic of snake populations isolated (or introduced) on islands from less than 30 years ago to more than 9000 years ago and exposed to selection for increased head size (i.e., ability to ingest large prey [13-16]). Here we show that a larger head size is achieved by plasticity in ""young"" populations and by genetic canalization in ""older"" populations. Island tiger snakes (Notechis scutatus) thus show clear empirical evidence of genetic assimilation, with the elaboration of an adaptive trait shifting from phenotypically plastic expression through to canalization within a few thousand years."

Methods We used boosted regression trees to evaluate the relative influence of, and relationship between, the invader's current pattern of distribution and a set of spatially explicit variables considered important to their colonization success. These variables are related to four well-known invasion hypotheses, namely the role of propagule pressure, climate matching, biotic resistance from known competitors, and human disturbance. Results Model predictions attained a high accuracy for the two invaders (mean AUC0.91). Propagule pressure and climatic suitability were identified as the primary drivers of colonization, but the former had a much higher relative influence on the red swamp crayfish. Climate matching was shown to have limited predictive value and climatic suitability models based on occurrences from other invaded areas had consistently higher relative explanatory power than models based on native range data. Biotic resistance and human disturbance were also shown to be weak predictors of the distribution of the two invaders. Main conclusions These results contribute to our general understanding of the factors that enable certain species to become notable invaders. Being primarily driven by propagule pressure and climatic suitability, we expect that, given their continued dispersal, the future distribution of these problematic decapods in Europe will increasingly represent their fundamental climatic niche."

Our results question the tens rule and do not show taxonomic differences in establishment success. Implications. Similar to studies on other taxa (birds and mammals), we found that establishment success was generally above 40%. This suggests that we should focus management on reducing the number of herptile species introduced because both reptiles and amphibians have a high likelihood of establishing.

This program determines species distributions in relation to climate, and can be used to express the favourableness of different localities for a species. CLIMEX is also a useful exploratory tool for determining the likelihood of establishment of species introduced from one area to another. Results Predictive models were developed based on the likelihood of establishment of fifteen Chilocorus spp. relative to their physiological characteristics and climatic tolerances. This likelihood was compared with actual establishment with a resultant range of 0% accuracy to 100% accuracy. Only four (26.7%) species climatic tolerances could the predicted with 100% certainty. The general lack of accurate prediction was because climate is not always the overriding feature determining whether a species will establish or not. Other determinants, such as localized response to microclimate, phenology, host type and availability, presence of natural enemies and hibernation sites play a varying role over and above climate in determining whether a species will establish at a new locality.

All in all, about half the valiance between islands/regions in their numbers of successfully and unsuccessfully introduced species can be accounted for by recipient site-specific variables; the most important correlate of success is the number of native species extinctions over about the last 3000 years, which reflects the degree of human activity and habitat destruction and deterioration through intrusions of exotic predators, herbivores, and parasites. Consequently, the number of exotic species gained is close to the number of species lost through extinction. Even after controlling for avian extinctions, island area correlates positively with introduced species number. Invasion success does not decline significantly with the richness of the native avifauna (after controlling for the effects of extinctions and island area) nor the variety of potential mammalian predators. The relative proportion of extinct native species across islands/regions is negatively correlated with area and positively correlated with introduced species number and the number of endemic species. A strong correlation exists between the number of success and the number of failures, attesting to the role of persistent acclimatization societies in increasing species numbers despite high failure rates. The relative success to failure rate increases with the number of extinct native species. The correlation between introductions and native extinctions seems to arise because native birds are usually more common, if not restricted, to native habitats while introduced birds are primary occupants of disturbed and open habitats. As more of an island's area is converted to urban, agricultural and disturbed habitats or altered through the introduction of herbivores and exotic predators, most natives lose good living space while most introduced birds, that frequent open and disturbed areas and have evolved in predator-rich areas, gain habitat. I find little support for the notion that rich avifaunas in themselves repel the establishment of avian invaders at the level of whole islands or archipelagoes.

Fundamentally, we must know where species that are threatened by invasive alien species (IAS) live, and the degree to which they are threatened. We report the first study linking 1372 vertebrates threatened by more than 200 IAS from the completely revised Global Invasive Species Database. New maps of the vulnerability of threatened vertebrates to IAS permit assessments of whether IAS have a major influence on biodiversity, and if so, which taxonomic groups are threatened and where they are threatened. We found that centres of IAS-threatened vertebrates are concentrated in the Americas, India, Indonesia, Australia and New Zealand. The areas in which IAS-threatened species are located do not fully match the current hotspots of invasions, or the current hotspots of threatened species. The relative importance of biological invasions as drivers of biodiversity loss clearly varies across regions and taxa, and changes over time, with mammals from India, Indonesia, Australia and Europe are increasingly being threatened by IAS. The chytrid fungus primarily threatens amphibians, whereas invasive mammals primarily threaten other vertebrates. The differences in IAS threats between regions and taxa can help efficiently target IAS, which is essential for achieving the Strategic Plan 2020 of the Convention on Biological Diversity."

Up to September 2004, 851 NIS (the majority being zoobenthic organ- isms) have been reported in European marine and brackish waters, the majority during the 1960s and 1970s. The Mediterranean is by far the major recipient of exotic species with an average of one introduction every 4 wk over the past 5 yr. Of the 25 species recorded in 2004, 23 were reported in the Mediterranean and only two in the Baltic. The most updated patterns and trends in the rate, mode of introduction and establishment success of introductions were examined, revealing a process similar to introductions in other parts of the world, but with the uniqueness of migrants through the Suez Canal into the Mediterranean (Lessepsian or Erythrean migration). Shipping appears to be the major vector of introduction (excluding the Lessepsian migration). Aquaculture is also an important vector with target species outnumbered by those introduced unintentionally. More than half of immigrants have been estab- lished in at least one regional sea. However, for a significant part of the introductions both the establishment success and mode of introduction remain unknown. Finally, comparing trends across taxa and seas is not as accurate as could have been wished because there are differences in the spatial and taxonomic effort in the study of NIS. These differences lead to the conclusion that the number of NIS remains an underestimate, calling for continuous updating and systematic research."

The availabilities of establishment microsites and water were manipulated in field plots for two years through the application of experimental soil disturbances and irrigation, respectively. Resource manipulations led to increased invasibility of the community, as predicted by the theory of fluctuating resources. Rates of colonization, enhanced by the sowing of 32 grassland species, increased plant diversity and above-ground productivity, but to a greater extent under conditions of resource enrichment. Although resource enrichment generally increased diversity and productivity, these responses were contingent upon species availability and tended to be more pronounced in the presence of an expanded propagule pool. These findings suggest that biodiversity at the level of the available propagule pool and fluctuations in resources interact to regulate local resident diversity and productivity by determining opportunities for species sorting, by mediating community assembly, and by governing the potential for functional compensation in the community."

Fire is frequently used in prairie restoration to control invasion by trees and shrubs, but may have additional consequences. For example, fire might reduce damage by herbivore and pathogen enemies by eliminating litter, which harbors eggs and spores. Less obviously, fire might influence enemy loads differently for native and introduced plant hosts. We used a controlled burn in a Willamette Valley (Oregon) prairie to examine these questions. We expected that, without fire, introduced host plants should have less damage than native host plants because the introduced species are likely to have left many of their enemies behind when they were transported to their new range (the enemy release hypothesis, or ERH). If the ERH holds, then fire, which should temporarily reduce enemies on all species, should give an advantage to the natives because they should see greater total reduction in damage by enemies. Prior to the burn, we censused herbivore and pathogen attack on eight plant species (five of nonnative origin: Bromus hordaceous, Cynosuros echinatus, Galium divaricatum, Schedonorus arundinaceus (=Festuca arundinacea), and Sherardia arvensis; and three natives: Danthonia californica, Epilobium minutum, and Lomatium nudicale). The same plots were monitored for two years post-fire. Prior to the burn, native plants had more kinds of damage and more pathogen damage than introduced plants, consistent with the ERH. Fire reduced pathogen damage relative to the controls more for the native than the introduced species, but the effects on herbivory were negligible. Pathogen attack was correlated with plant reproductive fitness, whereas herbivory was not. These results suggest that fire may be useful for promoting some native plants in prairies due to its negative effects on their pathogens."

We conducted a field experiment to examine the impact of resource manipulations and seed addition on the invasibility and diversity of a low-productivity grassland. We manipulated resource levels both by a disturbance treatment that reduced adult plant cover in the spring of the first year and by addition of fertilizer every year. Seeds of 46 native species, both resident and nonresident to the community,,were added in spring of the first year to determine the effects of recruitment limitation from local (seed limitation) and regional (dispersal limitation) sources on local species richness. Our results show that the unmanipulated community was not readily invasible. Seed addition increased the species richness of unmanipulated plots, but this was primarily due to increased occurrence of resident species. Nonresident species were only able to invade following a cover-reduction disturbance. Cover reduction resulted in an increase in nitrogen availability in the first year, but had no measurable effect on light availability in any year. In contrast, fertilization created a persistent increase in nitrogen availability that increased plant cover or biomass and reduced light penetration to ground level. Initially, fertilization had an overall positive effect on species richness, but by the third year, the effect was either negative or neutral. Unlike cover reduction, fertilization had no observable effect on seedling recruitment or occurrence (number of plots) of invading resident or nonresident species. The results of our experiment demonstrate that, although resource fluctuations can increase the invasibility of this grassland, the community response depends on the nature of the resource change."

We hypothesized that greater morphological plasticity may contribute to the ability of L. japonica to occupy more habitat types, and contribute to its invasiveness. We compared the morphology of plants provided with climbing supports with plants that had no climbing supports, and thus quantified their morphological plasticity in response to an important variable in their habitats. The two species responded differently to the treatments, with L. japonica showing greater responses in more characters. For example, Lonicera japonica responded to climbing supports with a 15.3% decrease in internode length, a doubling of internode number and a 43% increase in shoot biomass. In contrast, climbing supports did not influence internode length or shoot biomass for L. sempervirens, and only resulted in a 25% increase in internode number. This plasticity may allow L. japonica to actively place plant modules in favorable microhabitats and ultimately affect plant fitness."

We studied the effect of summer temperature (20 degrees C, 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C) and light availability (25% and 50% of incident light availability) on shoot establishment in terms of growth rate, photosynthesis, and morphology of three invasive aquatic plants (Elodea canadensis. Egeria densa and Lagarosiphon major) in order to assess their interspecific competition. Light availability had an overall stronger effect on growth rate and plant morphology than temperature in the three species. Growth rate increased three-fold from low to high light, and low light reduced belowground biomass, increased stem length, and reduced branching and lateral spread. Photosynthetic rates were the only parameter for which temperature had an equal or stronger effect than light availability. The results show that E. canadensis has the most competitive establishment of the three species in both high and low temperature and light availability. E. densa is most competitive in warm water compared to colder water, whereas the opposite pattern is present for L major which is most competitive in colder water. In conclusion, we suggest that that E. densa will dominate warmer, shallower waters, whereas L major will dominate in colder, clear-water lakes, while E. canadensis continues its established role as a pioneer species that is quickly replaced by the two taller species after their arrival.

We studied vegetation structure and expansion rate of B. orientalis stands and performed a series of experiments to investigate key factors that underlie the colonizing and establishment of B. orientalis. Reiterated observations exposed a high current expansion rate of B. orientalis populations and vegetation surveys of B. orientalis stands showed that these stands were mainly composed of Artemisietea and Arrhenateretea species. Regeneration experiments with root fragments revealed high regeneration capacities: root fragments of 3 cm length showed 93% regeneration, varying water content (10-50% water loss) and separation into root cortex and root stele yielded regeneration of 30 to 50%. In a field study high regrowth after mowing with varying mowing intensity indicates B. orientalis to be well adapted to disturbed sites as its preferential locations for development of dominance stands. Vegetative growth parameters were studied in two controlled growth experiments with elevated nutrient availabilities. B. orientalis exhibited a high sensitivity to nutrient addition and rosette sizes of maximal 90 cm were reached. Biomass was comparable or even higher than that of native ruderals grown in the same experiment. Measurements of reproductive parameters revealed a high reproductive effort (0.2 to 0.45 g g(-1)) even under intense mowing regimes, resulting in a dense seed bank with maximal values of about 400 fruits (congruent to 550 seeds) l(-1) soil. With respect to colonization and establishment of B. orientalis the results of our study enable the formulation of three hypotheses."

Moderate drought significantly reduced pre-dawn water potential, leaf relative water content, total biomass, total leaf area, above-ground biomass, total number of leaves and specific leaf area, but it increased the root/total weight ratio (0.23 versus 0.33) in C. korshinskii. Only severe drought significantly affected water status and growth in Z. xanthoxylum. In any given watering regime, a significantly higher total biomass was observed in Z xanthoxylum (1.14 g) compared to C. korshinskii (0.19 g). Moderate drought significantly increased Na+ ccumulation in all parts of Z xanthoxylum, e.g., moderate drought increased leaf Na+ concentration from 1.14 to 2.03 g/100 g DW, however, there was no change in Na+ (0.11 versus 0.12) in the leaf of C. korshinskii when subjected to moderate drought. Stomatal density increased as water availability was reduced in both C. korshinskii and Z xanthoxylum, but there was no difference in stomatal index of either species. Stomatal length and width, and pore width were significantly reduced by moderate water stress in Z xanthoxylum, but severe drought was required to produce a significant effect in C. korshinskii. These results indicated that C. korshinskii is more responsive to water stress and exhibits strong phenotypic plasticity especially in above-ground/below-ground biomass allocation. In contrast, Z xanthoxylum was more tolerant to water deficit, with a lower specific leaf area and a strong ability to maintain water status through osmotic adjustment and stomatal closure, thereby providing an effective strategy to cope with local extreme and environments."

The introduced red-whiskered bulbul (Pycnonotus jocosus) feeds on many fleshy-fruited species, and often moves from invaded and degraded habitats into higher quality native forests, thus potentially acting as a mediator of continued plant invasion into these areas. Furthermore, gut passage may influence seed germination. To investigate this, we fed fleshy fruits of two invasive plant species, Ligustrum robustum and Clidemia hirta, to red-whiskered bulbuls. Gut passage times of seeds were recorded. Gut-passed seeds were sown and their germination rate and germination success compared with that of hand-cleaned seeds, as well as that of seeds in whole fruits. Gut passage and hand-cleaning had significant positive effects on germination of both species. Gut-passed seeds of both C. hirta and L. robustum germinated faster than hand-cleaned seeds. However, for L. robustum, this was only true when compared with hand-cleaned seeds with intact endocarp; when compared with hand-cleaned seeds without endocarp, there was no difference. For overall germination success, there was a positive effect of gut passage for C. hirta, but not for L. robustum. For both C. hirta and L. robustum, no seeds in intact fruits geminated, suggesting that removal of pulp is essential for germination. Our results suggest that, first, the initial invasion of native forests in Mauritius may not have happened so rapidly without efficient avian seed dispersers like the red-whiskered bulbul. Second, the bulbul is likely to be a major factor in the continued re-invasion of C. hirta and L. robustum into weeded and restored conservation management areas."

The enemy release hypothesis states that parasite species will be lost from host populations when the host is introduced into new environments. Methods: We tested the enemy release hypothesis by comparing 14 native and 29 introduced minnow (Phoxinus phoxinus) populations in Norway with regard to the ectoparasitic Gyrodactylus species community and load (on caudal fin). Here, we used a nominal logistic regression on presence/absence of Gyrodactylus spp. and a generalized linear model on the summed number of Gyrodactylus spp. on infected populations, with individual minnow heterozygosity (based on 11 microsatellites) as a covariate. In addition, a sample-based rarefaction analysis was used to test if the Gyrodactylus-species specific load differed between native and introduced minnow populations. An analysis of molecular variance was performed to test for hierarchical population structure between the two groups and to test for signals of population bottlenecks the two-phase model in the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used. To test for demographic population expansion events in the introduced minnow population, we used the kg-test under a stepwise mutation model. Results: The native and introduced minnow populations had similar species compositions of Gyrodactylus, lending no support to the enemy release hypothesis. The two minnow groups did not differ in the likelihood of being infected with Gyrodactylus spp. Considering only infected minnow populations it was evident that native populations had a significantly higher mean abundance of Gyrodactylus spp. than introduced populations. The results showed that homozygotic minnows had a higher Gyrodactylus spp. infection than more heterozygotic hosts. Using only infected individuals, the two minnow groups did not differ in their mean number of Gyrodactylus spp. However, a similar negative association between heterozygosity and abundance was observed in the native and introduced group. There was no evidence for demographic bottlenecks in the minnow populations, implying that introduced populations retained a high degree of genetic variation, indicating that the number of introduced minnows may have been large or that introductions have been happening repeatedly. This could partly explain the similar species composition of Gyrodactylus in the native and introduced minnow populations. Conclusions: In this study it was observed that native and introduced minnow populations did not differ in their species community of Gyrodactylus spp., lending no support to the enemy release hypothesis. A negative association between individual minnow host heterozygosity and the number of Gyrodactylus spp. was detected. Our results suggest that the enemy release hypothesis does not necessarily limit fish parasite dispersal, further emphasizing the importance of invasive fish species dispersal control."

When primary invaders have altered more than one property of the recipient community, standard descriptive and modeling approaches only provide a best guess of the mechanism permitting the secondary invasion. In rainforest on Christmas Island, we conducted a manipulative field experiment to determine the mechanism of invasion success for a community of land snails dominated by non-native species. The invasion of rainforest by the yellow crazy ant (Anoplolepis gracilipes) has facilitated these land snails, either by creating enemy-free space and/or increased habitat and resources (in the form of leaf litter) through the removal of the native omnivorous-detritivorous red land crab (Gecarcoidea natalis). We manipulated predator densities (high and low) and leaf litter (high and low) in replicated blocks of four treatment combinations at two sites. Over the course of one wet season (five months), we found that plots with high leaf litter biomass contained significantly more snails than those with low biomass, regardless of whether those plots had high or low predation pressure, at both the site where land crabs have always been abundant, and at the site where they have been absent for many years prior to the experiment. Each site was dominated by small snail species (<2 mm length), and through handling size and predation experiments we demonstrated that red crabs tend not to handle and eat snails of that size. These results suggest that secondary invasion by this community of non-native land snails is facilitated most strongly by habitat and resource augmentation, an indirect consequence of red land crab removal, and that the creation of enemy-free space is not important. By using a full-factorial experimental approach, we have confidently determined-rather than inferred-the mechanism by which primary invaders indirectly facilitate a community of secondary invaders."

These alterations affect habitat structure and arthropod dynamics, such as those among host plants, tephritid fruit flies, and their natural enemies. We compared abundance and dynamics of pest and non-pest tephritids and their natural enemies over a mosaic of habitats differing in structure, diversity and disturbance history on the Sierra de San Javier in Tucuman, Argentina. Our prediction was that conserved habitats would be more resistant to the establishment and spread of invasive tephritid species due in part to a greater abundance of natural enemies, a greater diversity of native species in the same family and trophic level, and a greater wealth of biotic interactions. We further predicted that native species with broad host ranges should be more sensitive to habitat loss yet more competitive in less disturbed habitats than generalist native and exotic species. We found that environmental degradation, and introduction and spread of exotic host plants strongly affected distribution patterns, abundance, and phenology of native and exotic tephritids. Monophagous tephritid species and several specialized parasitoids were more sensitive to habitat loss than polyphagous species and parasitoids exhibiting a wide host range. In contrast, native monophagous species and native parasitoids appeared to exclude the invasive Mediterranean fruit fly from conserved patches of native vegetation. Nevertheless, the Mediterranean fruit fly persisted in uncontested exotic host plants and thrived in highly degradeted urban landscapes."

We studied patterns of exotic and native species richness across the Flooding Pampas of Argentina, and tested for exotic richness correlates with major environmental gradients, species pool size, and native richness, among and within different grassland habitat types. 2. Native and exotic richness were positively correlated across grassland types, increasing from lowland meadows and halophyte steppes, through humid to mesophyte prairies in more elevated topographic positions. Species pool size was positively correlated with local richness of native and exotic plants, being larger for mesophyte and humid prairies. Localities in the more stressful meadow and halophyte steppe habitats contained smaller fractions of their landscape species pools. 3. Native and exotic species numbers decreased along a gradient of increasing soil salinity and decreasing soil depth, and displayed a unimodal relationship with soil organic carbon. When covarying habitat factors were held constant, exotic and native richness residuals were still positively correlated across sites. Within grassland habitat types, exotic and native species richness were positively associated in meadows and halophyte steppes but showed no consistent relationship in the least stressful, prairie habitat types. 4. Functional group composition differed widely between native and exotic species pools. Patterns suggesting biotic resistance to invasion emerged only within humid prairies, where exotic richness decreased with increasing richness of native warm-season grasses. This negative relationship was observed for other descriptors of invasion such as richness and cover of annual cool-season forbs, the commonest group of exotics. 5. Our results support the view that ecological factors correlated with differences in invasion success change with the range of environmental heterogeneity encompassed by the analysis. Within narrow habitat ranges, invasion resistance may be associated with either physical stress or resident native diversity. Biotic resistance through native richness, however, appeared to be effective only at intermediate locations along a stress/fertility gradient. 6. We show that certain functional groups, not just total native richness, may be critical to community resistance to invasion. Identifying such native species groups is important for directing management and conservation efforts."

Range infilling potentially has the greatest impact on native communities and ecosystem processes, but receives much less attention than range expansion. 'Snapshot' studies of invasive plant dispersal, habitat and propagule limitations cannot determine whether a landscape is saturated or whether a species is actively infilling empty patches. We investigate the mechanisms underlying invasive plant infilling by tracking the localized movement and expansion of Microstegium vimineum populations from 2009 to 2011 at sites along a 100-km regional gradient in eastern U. S. deciduous forests. We find that infilling proceeds most rapidly where the invasive plants occur in warm, moist habitats adjacent to roads: under these conditions they produce copious seed, the dispersal distances of which increase exponentially with proximity to roadway. Invasion then appears limited where conditions are generally dry and cool as propagule pressure tapers off. Invasion also is limited in habitats >1 m from road corridors, where dispersal distances decline precipitously. In contrast to propagule and dispersal limitations, we find little evidence that infilling is habitat limited, meaning that as long as M. vimineum seeds are available and transported, the plant generally invades quite vigorously. Our results suggest an invasive species continues to spread, in a stratified manner, within the invaded landscape long after first arriving. These dynamics conflict with traditional invasion models that emphasize an invasive edge with distinct boundaries. We find that propagule pressure and dispersal regulate infilling, providing the basis for projecting spread and landscape coverage, ecological effects and the efficacy of containment strategies."

While the morphology and phenology of the chosen bromes (Bromus tectorum, Bromus sterilis and Bromus squarrosus) are highly similar, we measured complex traits often associated with invasive success: phenotypic plasticity, competitive ability and generalist-specialist character. We performed common-garden experiments, community- and landscape-level surveys in areas of co-occurrence in Central Europe (Hungary) that could have served as donor region for American introductions. According to our results, the three bromes are unequally equipped with trait that could enhance invasiveness. B. tectorum possesses several traits that may be especially relevant: it has uniquely high phenotypic plasticity, as demonstrated in a nitrogen addition experiment, and it is a habitat generalist, thriving in a wide range of habitats, from semi-natural to degraded ones, and having the widest co-occurrence based niche-breadth. The strength of B. sterilis lies in its ability to use resources unexploited by other species. It can become dominant, but only in one non-natural habitat type, namely the understorey of the highly allelopathic stands of the invasive Robinia pseudoacacia. B. squarrosus is a habitat specialist with low competitive ability, always occurring with low coverage. This ranking of the species' abilities can explain the current spreading success of the three bromes on the North American continent, and highlight the high potential of prehistoric invaders (European archaeophytes) to become invasive elsewhere.

Because ants are generally poor pollinators, plants often protect their floral nectar against ants. Ants were historically absent from the geographically isolated Hawaiian archipelago, which harbors one of the most endemic floras in the world. We hypothesized that native Hawaiian plants lack floral features that exclude ants and therefore would be heavily exploited by introduced, invasive ants. To test this hypothesis, ant-flower interactions involving co-occurring native and introduced plants were observed in 10 sites on three Hawaiian Islands. We quantified the residual interaction strength of each pair of antplant species as the deviation of the observed interaction frequency from a null-model prediction based on available nectar sugar in a local plant community and local ant activity at sugar baits. As predicted, flowers of plants that are endemic or indigenous to Hawaii were more strongly exploited by ants than flowers of co-occurring introduced plants, which shared an evolutionary history with ants. We also found that the percentage of plant species with ant-visited flowers was much higher in Hawaii than in other island and continental systems, even reaching 100% in habitats dominated by endemic species. We showed experimentally that the absence of ants on flowers of most introduced and few native plants species was due to morphological barriers, repellent floral scents, and to a lesser extent, unpalatable nectar. Analysis of floral volatiles, however, revealed no consistent ant-repellent ""syndrome"" attributable to negative responses by ants, probably due to the high chemical variability within the floral scent bouquets. Results from a molecular phylogeny imply that floral defenses against ants were convergently lost in native Hawaiian plants. Exploitation of floral nectar by ants may be an important threat to Hawaiian ecosystems, reducing nectar resources available to native flower visitors and potentially reducing the reproductive success of the endangered endemic flora."

The local species richness differed between regions and host species, but did not differ when compared with invasive and native hosts. The size of parasite assemblages of endohelminths was higher in the Mediterranean and Azov-Black Seas, while monogeneans were the most diverse in the Sea of Japan. The helminth diversity was apparently higher in the introduced population of Liza haematocheilus than that in their native habitat, but this trend could not be confirmed when the size of geographic range and sampling efforts were controlled for. The parasite species richness at the infracommunity level of the invasive host population is significantly lower compared with that of the native host populations that lends support to the enemy release hypothesis. A distribution pattern of the infracommunity richness of acquired parasites by the invasive host can be characterized as aggregated and it is random in native host populations. Heterogeneity in the host susceptibility and vulnerability to acquired helminth species was assumed to be a reason of the aggregation of species numbers in the population of the invasive host.

Herbaceous layer contrast and alien plant occurrence in utility corridors and riparian forests of the Allegheny High Plateau. J. Torrey Bot.

Despite their economic importance, construction and maintenance of utility corridors can have negative impacts on the natural ecosystems that they traverse. For example, utility corridors can serve as foci for invasion of native plant communities by alien plant species that can adversely affect community structure and function. To determine how corridor establishment influences riparian vegetation of the Allegheny High Plateau of northwestern Pennsylvania, we compared the species composition and richness of the herbaceous layer (all vascular plants 7 1 In tall) of utility corridors and adjacent headwater riparian forests. and tested the hypothesis that utility corridors serve as foci for the invasion of adjacent riparian forest by alien vascular plants. We contrasted plant species richness and vegetative cover. cover by growth form, species richness and cover of alien plants and cover of microhabitat components (open soil, rock, leaf litter, log. bryophyte) in utility corridors and adjacent riparian forest at 17 sites. Cluster analysis revealed that herbaceous layer species assemblages in corridors and riparian forest were compositionally distinct. Herbaceous layer cover and species richness were significantly (P less than or equal to 0.05) greater in corridors than in riparian forest. Fern. graminoid, and forb species co-dominated herbaceous layer cover in corridors fern cover dominated riparian forests. Cover of alien plants was significantly greater in corridors than in riparian forest. Alien plant species richness and cover were significantly and positively correlated with open soil. floodplain width, and active channel width in corridors but were significantly and negatively correlated with litter cover in riparian forest. Given that the majority of alien plant species we found in corridors were shade-intolerant and absent from riparian forests, we conclude that open utility corridors primarily serve as habitat refugia, rather than as invasion foci. for alien plant species in riparian forests of the Allegheny High Plateau."

Nevertheless, it is unclear whether these new associations are quantitatively significant compared to the assemblages with native flora under natural conditions.Herbivores associated with two exotic plants, namely Senecio inaequidens and S. pterophorus, and two coexisting natives, namely S. vulgaris and S. lividus, were surveyed in a replicated long-term field study to ascertain whether the plant-herbivore assemblages in mixed communities are related to plant novelty and insect diet breadth.Native herbivores used exotic Senecio as their host plants. Of the 19 species of Lepidoptera, Diptera, and Hemiptera found in this survey, 14 were associated with the exotic Senecio plants. Most of these species were polyphagous, yet we found a higher number of individuals with a narrow diet breadth, which is contrary to the assumption that host switching mainly occurs in generalist herbivores.The Senecio specialist Sphenella marginata (Diptera: Tephritidae) was the most abundant and widely distributed insect species (ca. 80% of the identified specimens). Sphenella was associated with S. lividus, S. vulgaris and S. inaequidens and was not found on S. pterophorus. The presence of native plant congeners in the invaded community did not ensure an instantaneous ecological fitting between insects and alien plants.We conclude that novel associations between native herbivores and introduced Senecio plants are common under natural conditions. Plant novelty is, however, not the only predictor of herbivore abundance due to the complexity of natural conditions."

An important step in this process is to assess the impact on invertebrate communities. Here we analyse insect species richness and abundance in sweep collections from indigenous and alien (Australasian) woody plant species in South Africa's Western Cape. We use phylogenetically relevant comparisons and compare one indigenous with three Australasian alien trees within each of Fabaceae: Mimosoideae, Myrtaceae, and Proteaceae: Grevilleoideae. Although some of the alien species analysed had remarkably high abundances of herbivores, even when intentionally introduced biological control agents are discounted, overall, herbivorous insect assemblages from alien plants were slightly less abundant and less diverse compared with those from indigenous plants - in accordance with predictions from the enemy release hypothesis. However, there were no clear differences in other insect feeding guilds. We conclude that insect assemblages from alien plants are generally quite diverse, and significant differences between these and assemblages from indigenous plants are only evident for herbivorous insects."

Field surveys were carried out in the central part of mainland Japan for five years including an intensive regular survey in 1992. Thirty-nine arthropod species were found feeding on the weed. The leaf, stem, flower and fruit of the weed were infested by the herbivores. The comparison of characteristics of the arthropod community with those of the community in the USA indicated that more sapsuckers and less chewers were on the weed in Japan than in the USA. The community in Japan was composed of high proportions of polyphages and exophages compared to that in the USA. Eighty-seven percent of the species are known to be pests of agricultural crops. Low species diversity of the community was also suggested.

The reduced herbivory may cause a reallocation of resources from defence to fitness. Here, we evaluated leaf herbivory of an invasive tree species (Ligustrum lucidum Aiton) in its native and novel ranges, and determined the potential changes in leaf traits that may be associated with the patterns of herbivory. We measured forest structure, damage by herbivores and leaf traits in novel and native ranges, and on the basis of the literature, we identified the common natural herbivores of L. lucidum. We also performed an experiment offering leaves from both ranges to a generalist herbivore (Spodoptera frugiperda). L. lucidum was more abundant and experienced significantly less foliar damage in the novel than in the native range, in spite of the occurrence of several natural herbivores. The reduced lignin content and lower lignin : N ratio in novel leaves, together with the higher herbivore preference for leaves of this origin in the laboratory experiment, indicated lower herbivore resistance in novel than in native populations. The reduced damage by herbivores is not the only factor explaining invasion success, but it may be an important cause that enhances the invasiveness of L. lucidum."

Furthermore, previous evidence suggests that non-indigenous species introduced via hull fouling may be capable of adapting to metal-polluted environments. Using a laboratory based toxicity assay, we investigated tolerance to copper in the non-indigenous bryozoan Watersipora subtorquata from four source populations. Individual colonies were collected from four sites within Port Hacking (Sydney, Australia) and their offspring exposed to a range of copper concentrations. This approach, using a fullsib, split-family design, tests for a genotype by environment (G x E) interaction. Settlement and complete metamorphosis (recruitment) were measured as ecologically relevant endpoints. Larval sizes were also measured for each colony. Successful recruitment was significantly reduced by the highest copper concentration of 80 mu g L-1. While there was no difference in pollution tolerance between sites, there was a significant G x E interaction, with large variation in the response of colony offspring within sites. Larval size differed significantly both between sites and between colonies and was positively correlated with tolerance. The high level of variation in copper tolerance between colonies suggests that there is considerable potential within populations to adapt to elevated copper levels, as tolerance is a heritable trait. Also, colonies that produce large larvae are more tolerant to copper, suggesting that tolerance may be a direct consequence of larger size. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

Movement of wood products has facilitated EAB spread, and heat sanitation of wooden materials according to International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures No. 15 (ISPM 15) is used to prevent this. 2 In the present study, we assessed the thermal conditions experienced during a typical heat-treatment at a facility using protocols for pallet wood treatment under policy PI-07, as implemented in Canada. The basal high temperature tolerance of EAB larvae and pupae was determined, and the observed heating rates were used to investigate whether the heat shock response and expression of heat shock proteins occurred in fourth-instar larvae. 3 The temperature regime during heat treatment greatly exceeded the ISPM 15 requirements of 56 degrees C for 30 min. Emerald ash borer larvae were highly tolerant of elevated temperatures, with some instars surviving exposure to 53 degrees C without any heat pre-treatments. High temperature survival was increased by either slow warming or pre-exposure to elevated temperatures and a recovery regime that was accompanied by up-regulated hsp70 expression under some of these conditions. 4 Because EAB is highly heat tolerant and exhibits a fully functional heat shock response, we conclude that greater survival than measured in vitro is possible under industry treatment conditions (with the larvae still embedded in the wood). We propose that the phenotypic plasticity of EAB may lead to high temperature tolerance very close to conditions experienced in an ISPM 15 standard treatment."

In the Sonoran Desert, Erodium cicutarium has increased in abundance over the last 30 years. While native species in this flora exhibit a strong among-species trade-off between relative growth rate and water-use efficiency, E. cicutarium seems to have a higher relative growth rate for its water-use efficiency value relative to the pattern across native species. This novel trait combination could provide the non-native species with a competitive advantage in this water-limited environment. To test the hypothesis that E. cicutarium is able to achieve high growth rates due to release from native herbivores, we compared the effects of herbivory on E. cicutarium and its native congener, Erodium texanum. We also compared these two species across a range of environmental conditions, both in a common garden and in two distinct seasons in the field, using growth analysis, isotopic compositions and leaf-level gas exchange. Additionally, we compared the competitive abilities of the two Erodium species in a greenhouse experiment. We found no evidence of herbivory to either species. Physiological measurements in a common environment revealed that E. cicutarium was able to achieve high growth rates while simultaneously controlling leaf-level water loss. Non-native E. cicutarium responded to favourable conditions in the field with greater specific leaf area and leaf area ratio than native E. texanum. The non-native Erodium was a stronger competitor than its native congener in a green-house competition experiment. The ability to maintain relatively higher values of water-use efficiency: relative growth rate in comparison to the native flora may be what enables E. cictarium to outcompete native species in both wet and dry years, resulting in an increase in abundance in the highly variable Sonoran Desert."

High-mountain habitats have been particularly useful for evaluation of the relative importance of environmental conditions in the colonization and invasion process, because they have heterogeneous and stressful climatic conditions, inducing photoinhibition. Light intensity is one of the most changing conditions along altitudinal gradients, showing more variability in higher altitudes. In this study, we analyzed the plasticity in photoprotective strategies and performance of the invasive Taraxacum officinale. Additionally, we tested whether higher plasticity enhances competitive ability in an alpine environment We conducted an experiment to evaluate plasticity with a second generation (F2) of T. officinale individuals from 1,600 to 3,600 m, in a greenhouse with variation in light intensity. Treatments consisted of transferring 120 individuals from each altitude to two conditions of light intensity. We then recorded concentrations of photoprotection pigment, de-epoxidation state of the xanthophyll cycle, foliar angles, photochemical efficiency by fluorescence of photosystem II, total dry biomass and flower production. Additionally, we compared plasticity in both photoprotective and performance traits between T. officinale and the co-occurring native species Hypochaeris thrincioides. Finally, we performed a manipulative experiment under two light regimes in order to assess the competitive outcome between the invasive T. officinale and the native H. thrincioides. Individuals from higher altitude showed significantly greater plasticity than individuals from lower altitude. Similarly, individuals under high light intensity showed higher levels of photoprotective pigments, biomass and flower production. On the other hand, the invasive plant species showed significantly greater plasticity than the co-occurring native species, and a strong negative impact on the biomass of the native plant. Phenotypic plasticity seems to be a successful strategy in T. officinale to compete with native species and may be positively associated with the success of invasions, being greater in individuals from more heterogeneous and stressful environments."

We predicted that P. arundinacea would show a highly plastic response in important growth and physiological traits to treatment conditions (presence of three-way interactions and large phenotypic plasticity index (PI) values) because of its ability to persist in variable environments. MANOVA tests showed significant three-way interactions for each of the three groups of plant traits (aboveground (AGB) and belowground biomass (BGB), shoot C/N and root C/N ratios, leaf chlorophyll and soluble protein), demonstrating the complex correlated response to the treatment effects by pairs of response variables. There were significant three-way interactions for seven of nine plant traits (univariate analyses), including AGB and BGB, AGB per tiller, shoot/root ratio, shoot C/N ratio, root C/N ratio and leaf chlorophyll content. Total plasticity values, which represented the greatest possible plasticity for each plant trait, were larger than any of the PI values for the main effects. Understanding which traits show plasticity, as well as the magnitude of response expressed in common invasive species is an important area of research because aspects of their aggressive behavior may be explained by how they grow and allocate resources under variable environmental conditions, which in turn can be important when seeking to make predictions about the probability and degree of invasion success with species-specific invasion models.

For example, significant delays can occur between the human activities permitting the arrival of an invader, the establishment of this new species, and the manifestation of its impacts. In this context, to assess the influence of anthropogenic disturbances, it may become necessary to include a historical perspective. In this study, we reconstructed the history of human activities in a temperate forest now protected as a nature reserve to evaluate the magnitude and duration of the impact of human disturbances (e.g. trails, old quarries), as well as environmental factors, in explaining the probability of occurrence and the intensity of invasion by non-native earthworms and plants. The present-day patterns of distribution and intensity of earthworms and plants were better explained by proximity to the oldest human disturbances (initiated more than a century ago) than by proximity to more recent disturbances or to all disturbances combined. We conclude that understanding present-day patterns of non-native species invasions may often require reconstructing the history of human disturbances that occurred decades or even centuries in the past."

Attendant ants obtain a high-energy carbohydrate of predictable availability, while the homopteran trophobiont gains protection from natural enemies and potential benefits of sanitation (honeydew removal), maintenance of host-plant quality, and transport. In a California, USA, arboretum, we observed large numbers of dead and dying Argentine ants (Linepithema humile) that had become entrapped on viscid flower buds and flowers of South African species of Erica as they attempted to tend a South African mealybug (Delottococcus confusus). Mealybugs on viscid ericas were found on clusters of small buds before they had become sticky (and later in other areas that minimized exposure to stickiness). As buds developed, they became viscid, enclosing mealybugs within sticky flower parts and precluding further attendance by ants. Ants, however, were able to tend mealybugs without disruption on nonsticky ericas. Counts (n = 118) of haphazardly chosen stems of sticky ericas showed that significantly more dead ants were present on mealybug-infested stems. We suggest that evolutionary histories help explain the disparate outcomes for ants and mealybugs on sticky ericas. The Argentine ant lacks an evolutionary history with sticky ericas, whereas the native South African mealybug presumably shares an evolutionary relationship with species of Erica in South Africa's Cape Floristic Region. We propose that the mealybug's behavior and waxy coating are adaptations for circumventing plant stickiness. Our observations might represent the first documentation of plant stickiness disrupting an ant-homopteran association."

Disproportionate levels of invasion across the landscape indicate that propagule pressure and ecosystem characteristics can mediate invasion success. However, most invasion predictions relate to species' characteristics (invasiveness) and habitat requirements. Given myriad invaders and the inability to generalize from single-species studies, more general predictions about invasion are required. We present a simple new method for characterizing and predicting landscape susceptibility to invasion that is not species-specific. Location Corangamite catchment (13,340 km(2)), south-east Australia. Methods Using spatially referenced data on the locations of non-native plant species, we modelled their expected proportional cover as a function of a site's environmental conditions and geographic location. Models were built as boosted regression trees (BRTs). Results On average, the BRTs explained 38% of variation in occupancy and abundance of all exotic species and exotic forbs. Variables indicating propagule pressure, human impacts, abiotic and community characteristics were rated as the top four most influential variables in each model. Presumably reflecting higher propagule pressure and resource availability, invasion was highest near edges of vegetation fragments and areas of human activity. Sites with high vegetation cover had higher probability of occupancy but lower proportional cover of invaders, the latter trend suggesting a form of biotic resistance. Invasion patterns varied little in time despite the data spanning 34 years. conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first multispecies model based on occupancy and abundance data used to predict invasion risk at the landscape scale. Our approach is flexible and can be applied in different biomes, at multiple scales and for different taxonomic groups. Quantifying general patterns and processes of plant invasion will increase understanding of invasion and community ecology. Predicting invasion risk enables spatial prioritization of weed surveillance and control."

Location: River Jizera basin, north Bohemia, Czech Republic. Methods: Nine 0.25 km2 plots were chosen along the river. Within each plot all main habitat types were determined and sampled using the Braun-Blanquet scale to determine the invasibility of various communities. The patches invaded by Reynoutria taxa and surrounding Reynoutria-free vegetation in the same habitat type were sampled as releve pairs to compare the composition of invaded and non-invaded vegetation. In addition, to characterize the genetic structure of Reynoutria populations along the river, 30 samples from different clones were collected. Results and conclusions: 1. The species richness of communities has no influence on the success of Reynoutria invasion in the area studied. The combination of environmental conditions and propagule spread is more important to the invasion success than the number of species in the host community. 2. Reynoutria invasion greatly reduces species diversity. 3. R. japonica invaded more habitat types than R. sachalinensis and R. bohemica. The hybrid R. bohemica outcompetes the parental taxa at sites where both taxa co-occur. 4. Isozyme analysis revealed phenotype variability in the hybrid in contrast to the parental taxa. Different hybrid phenotypes are distributed randomly on the middle and lower reaches of the River Jizera; one of them dominates and the other three occur occasionally. This pattern supports the hypothesis that sexual reproduction occasionally occurs within Reynoutria taxa."

An outstanding question is how propagule pressure determines the probability of population establishment, where propagule pressure is the number of individuals of a species introduced into a specific location (propagule size) and their frequency of introduction (propagule number). Here, we used large-scale replicated mesocosm ponds over three reproductive seasons to identify how propagule size and number predict the probability of establishment of one of world's most invasive fish, Pseudorasbora parva, as well as its effect on the somatic growth of individuals during establishment. We demonstrated that, although a threshold of 11 introduced pairs of fish (a pair is 1 male, 1 female) was required for establishment probability to exceed 95%, establishment also occurred at low propagule size (1-5 pairs). Although single introduction events were as effective as multiple events at enabling establishment, the propagule sizes used in the multiple introductions were above the detected threshold for establishment. After three reproductive seasons, population abundance was also a function of propagule size, with rapid increases in abundance only apparent when propagule size exceeded 25 pairs. This was initially assisted by adapted biological traits, including rapid individual somatic growth that helped to overcome demographic bottlenecks."

Darwin's naturalization hypothesis assessed on Mediterranean islands","10.1111/j.1365-2699.2006.01486.x","Aim Recent works have found the presence of native congeners to have a small effect on the naturalization rates of introduced plants, some suggesting a negative interaction (as proposed by Charles Darwin in The Origin of Species), and others a positive association. We assessed this question for a new biogeographic region, and discuss some of the problems associated with data base analyses of this type.Location Islands of the Mediterranean basin.Methods Presence or absence of congeners was assessed for all naturalized alien plants species at regional, local and habitat scales. Using general linear models, we attempted to explain the abundance of the species (as measured by the number of islands where recorded) from their congeneric status, and assessed whether the patterns could be alternatively accounted for by a range of biological, geographical and anthropogenic factors. A simulation model was also used to investigate the impact of a simple bias on a comparable but hypothetical data set.Results Data base analyses addressing Darwin's hypothesis are prone to bias from a number of sources. Interaction between invaders and congenerics may be overestimated, as they often do not co-occur in the same habitats. Furthermore, intercorrelations between naturalization success and associated factors such as introduction frequency, which are also not independent from relatedness with the native flora, may generate an apparent influence of congenerics without implying a biological interaction. We detected no true influence from related natives on the successful establishment of alien species of the Mediterranean. Rarely-introduced species tended to fare better in the presence of congeners, but it appears that this effect was generated because species introduced accidentally into highly invasible agricultural and ruderal habitats have many relatives in the region, due to common evolutionary origins.Main conclusions Relatedness to the native flora has no more than a marginal influence on the invasion success of alien plants in the Mediterranean, although apparent trends can easily be generated through artefacts of the data base."

Location: Sani Pass road. Grassland biome, South Africa. Methods: On both sides of this road. presence and abundance of exotic plants was recorded in four 25-m long road-verge plots and in parallel 25 m x 2 m adjacent land plots, nested at five altitudinal levels: 1500, 1800, 2100, 2400 and 2700 in a.s.l. Exotic community structure was analyzed using Canonical Correspondence Analysis while a two-level nested Generalized Linear Model was fitted for richness and cover of exotics. We tested the upper altitudinal limits tor all exotics along this road for spatial clustering around four potential propagule sources Using a t-test. Results: Community structure, richness and abundance of exotics were negatively correlated with altitude. Greatest invasion by exotics was recorded for adjacent land at the 1500 in level. Of the 45 exotics, 16 were found at higher altitudes than expected and observations were spatially clustered around potential propagule sources. Conclusions: Spatial clustering of upper altitudinal limits around human inhabited areas suggests that exotics originate from these areas, while exceeding expected altitudinal limits suggests that distribution ranges of exotics are presently underestimated. Excites are generally characterised by a high propagule pressure and/or persistent seedbanks, thus future tarring of the Sani Pass may result in art increase of exotic species richness and abundance. This would initially result from construct ion-related soil disturbance and subsequently from increased traffic. water run-off, and altered fire frequency. We suggest examples of management actions to prevent this."

Understanding the relative role of the different factors has important scientific and applied implications. Here, we examined the relative effect of human-related and natural factors in determining the richness of exotic bird species established across Europe. Using hierarchical partitioning, which controls for covariation among factors, we show that the most important factor is the human-related community-level propagule pressure (the number of exotic species introduced), which is often not included in invasion studies due to the lack of information for this early stage in the invasion process. Another, though less important, factor was the human footprint (an index that includes human population size, land use and infrastructure). Biotic and abiotic factors of the environment were of minor importance in shaping the number of established birds when tested at a European extent using 50 x 50 km(2) grid squares. We provide, to our knowledge, the first map of the distribution of exotic bird richness in Europe. The richest hotspot of established exotic birds is located in southeastern England, followed by areas in Belgium and The Netherlands. Community-level propagule pressure remains the major factor shaping the distribution of exotic birds also when tested for the UK separately. Thus, studies examining the patterns of establishment should aim at collecting the crucial and hard-to-find information on community-level propagule pressure or develop reliable surrogates for estimating this factor. Allowing future introductions of exotic birds into Europe should be reconsidered carefully, as the number of introduced species is basically the main factor that determines the number established."

I surveyed populations from beaches and wetlands and conducted a common garden experiment to test for variation in drought tolerance and phenotype among populations and habitats. All populations were composed mostly of first- and later-generation hybrids. I found significant variation among populations in growth, lamina size, specific leaf area (SLA), and biomass allocation, in both the field and the common garden. Lamina size, growth, and root-to-shoot responded plastically to drought treatment. Wetland populations tolerated drought as well as beach populations.

Both adult and juvenile bullfrogs depended on terrestrial arthropods, and juveniles exhibited a moderate dependence on crayfish. The turtle showed little dependence on crayfish.4.These results suggest that eradication of snakeheads risks the possibility of mesopredator release, while such risk appears to be low in other alien predators.

However, uncertainty remains about restoration's ability to limit exotic species, particularly in deserts where facilitative interactions between plants are prevalent. Using candidate native species for restoration in the Mojave Desert of the southwestern U.S.A., we experimentally assembled a range of plant communities from early successional forbs to late-successional shrubs and assessed which vegetation types reduced the establishment of the priority invasive annuals Bromus rubens (red brome) and Schismus spp. (Mediterranean grass) in control and N-enriched soils. Compared to early successional grass and shrub and late-successional shrub communities, an early forb community best resisted invasion, reducing exotic species biomass by 88% (N added) and 97% (no N added) relative to controls (no native plants). In native species monocultures, Sphaeralcea ambigua (desert globemallow), an early successional forb, was the least invasible, reducing exotic biomass by 91%. However, the least-invaded vegetation types did not reduce soil N or P relative to other vegetation types nor was native plant cover linked to invasibility, suggesting that other traits influenced native-exotic species interactions. This study provides experimental field evidence that native vegetation types exist that may reduce exotic grass establishment in the Mojave Desert, and that these candidates for restoration are not necessarily late-successional communities. More generally, results indicate the importance of careful native species selection when exotic species invasions must be constrained for restoration to be successful."

Here we simultaneously map in detail effects of invaders on parameters describing the topology of both plant-pollinator (bi-modal) and plant-plant (uni-modal) networks. We focus on the invader Opuntia spp., a cosmopolitan alien cactus. We compare two island systems: Tenerife (Canary Islands) and Menorca (Balearic Islands). Opuntia was found to modify the number of links between plants and pollinators, and was integrated into the new communities via the most generalist pollinators, but did not affect the general network pattern. The plant uni-modal networks showed disassortative linkage, i.e. species with many links tended to connect to species with few links. Thus, by linking to generalist natives, Opuntia remained peripheral to network topology, and this is probably why native network properties were not affected at least in one of the islands. We conclude that the network analytical approach is indeed a valuable tool to evaluate the effect of invaders on native communities."

Avenues and roadsides have been planted with eastern Australian species, including Eucalyptus cladocalyx (sugar gum) and Eucalyptus botryoides (southern mahogany), both of which have become invasive. The present study examined the effect of a recent burn on the level of herbivory on these native and exotic eucalypts. Leaf damage, shoot extension and number of new leaves were measured on tagged shoots of saplings of each tree species in unburnt and burnt areas over an 8-month period. Leaf macronutrient levels were quantified and the number of arthropods on saplings was measured at the end of the recording period by chemical knockdown. Leaf macronutrients were mostly higher in all four species in the burnt area, and this was associated with generally higher numbers of canopy arthropods and greater levels of leaf damage. It is suggested that the pulse of soil nutrients after the fire resulted in more nutrient-rich foliage, which in turn was more palatable to arthropods. The resulting high levels of herbivory possibly led to reduced shoot extension of E. gomphocephala, E. botryoides and, to a lesser extent, E. cladocalyx. This acts as a negative feedback mechanism that lessens the tendency for lush, post-fire regrowth to outcompete other species of plants. There was no consistent difference in the levels of the various types of leaf damage or of arthropods on the native and the exotic eucalypts, suggesting that freedom from herbivory is not contributing to the invasiveness of the two exotic species."

Ligustrum lucidum is one of the most important invasive woody species in several ecosystems of Argentina; however, its impact on soil seed bank communities has not been studied. Here we analyzed differences in species richness, total seed density and species composition (total, native and exotic species) in the soil seed bank of native and invaded woodlands, in two different seasons. We also analyzed differences in similarity between standing vegetation and soil seed banks of both woodland types. The study was carried out in the Chaco Serrano woodlands of Crdoba, central Argentina. Our main results indicate differences in L. lucidum woodland composition and a reduction in both richness and total density of species in the soil seed bank compared to the native woodlands, independently of the sampling season. Moreover, a higher abundance of certain exotic species in the soil seed bank was observed in L. lucidum woodlands, particularly in spring. Finally, low similarity between soil seed bank and the established vegetation was observed in both woodland types. From a management perspective, it seems that passive restoration from soil seed banks of L. lucidum might be coupled with active addition of some native woody species and control of other exotic species."

Predicting how invasibility responds to multiple anthropogenic impacts is particularly challenging due to the variety of potential stressors and complex responses. Using manipulative field experiments, we examined the relative impact of perturbations that primarily change abiotic or biotic factors to promote invasion in coastal salt marsh plant communities. Specifically we test the hypotheses that nitrogen enrichment and human trampling facilitate invasion of upland weeds into salt marsh, and that the ability of salt marsh communities to resist and/or recover from invasion is modified by hydrological conditions. Nitrogen enrichment affected invasion of non-native upland plants at only one of six sites, and increased aboveground native marsh biomass at only two sites. Percent cover of native marsh plants declined with trampling at all sites, but recovered earlier at tidally flushed sites than at tidally restricted sites. Synergistic interactions between trampling and restricting tidal flow resulted in significantly higher cover of non-native upland plants in trampled plots at tidally restricted sites. Percent cover of non-native plants recovered to pre-trampling levels in fully tidal sites, but remained higher in tidally restricted sites after 22 months. Thus, perturbations that reduce biotic resistance interact with perturbations that alter abiotic conditions to promote invasion. This suggests that to effectively conserve or restore native biodiversity in altered systems, one must consider impacts of multiple human disturbances, and the interactions between them."

This study, located in Connecticut, USA, focused on the soil effects of the liana, Celastrus orbiculatus (oriental bittersweet), a prominent invader of eastern North America, using two different approaches. In a litter addition experiment, addition of C. orbiculatus leaf litter to uninvaded field soils showed an increase in soil nutrients, pH, and nitrogen mineralization over 2 years across a range of soil and forest community types. In a complimentary common garden-pot experiment, a suite of common, ecologically similar, native and invasive lianas and shrubs were grown in soils primed with C. orbiculatus. Invaded soil was compared to uninvaded field and control potting soils. The change in soil attributes was not significantly different when grown with native or invasive plants; however, soils grown with lianas had a greater decrease in nutrients than those grown with shrubs. Although soils from locations with C. orbiculatus were higher in nutrients than uninvaded soils, plant growth, as measured in root:shoot, root and stem biomass, relative growth rate of volume, and final biomass were not different in invaded and uninvaded soils for either lianas or shrubs. However, lianas had similar growth patterns in nutrient-sparse potting soil, while shrubs growing in potting soil had lower growth. Thus, negative impacts of invaded soils on plant growth are not universal, and the plant community may show a varied response to C. orbiculatus-primed soils depending on the level of resource competition."

The combined effects of introduced species on the structure of the native freshwater fish community were quantified by electrofishing 28 stream reaches within four riparian habitat types (forest, grassland, shrubland, and beaver-affected habitat) in 23 watersheds and by measuring related habitat variables (water velocity, substrate type, depth. and the percentage of pools). Three native stream fish species (puye Galaxias maculatus [also known as inanga], Aplochiton taeniatus, and A. zebra) were found along with brook trout and rainbow trout., but puye was the only native species that was common and widespread. The reaches affected by beaver impoundments had significantly higher puye densities than all other reaches in this study. These results are comparable to those reported for other streams in southern Chile. The presence of trout reduced the abundance of puye, but only in beaver-affected areas: all three natural riparian habitat types had uniformly low puye abundance and were unaffected by the presence or absence of trout. The data suggest that one invasive species, the beaver, enhanced puye habitat and thereby increased the abundance of that species, which, in turn, helped moderate the negative impacts of invasive trout."

However, it also has been reported that increased disturbance resource availability and decreased competition with native species may result in the invasion of communities by alien plant species, as predicted by the fluctuating resources theory of invasibility. In this study, we investigated the importance of European mole disturbances for the invasion of semi-natural fresh meadows and pastures by the alien plant, Bunks orientalis, which has mainly spread throughout Central Europe on anthropogenically disturbed sites. We hypothesized that the invader, being particularly well adapted to anthropogenic disturbances, enters into dense vegetation of meadows and pastures mainly on mole mounds. To assess the seedling recruitment of Bunks orientalis in relation to disturbance, we counted the number of seedlings that emerged on molehills and control plots in meadows and pastures. The establishment of juvenile (0-1 year) rosette plants on and off molehills was surveyed on 5 x 5 m plots. In accordance with our hypothesis, mole disturbances were found to serve as a gateway for Bunks orientalis by which the invader may colonize semi-natural grasslands. The seedlings of the species emerged almost solely on molehills and the young rosettes were established predominantly on mole mounds. Although the seedling density did not differ significantly between the meadows and pastures, the number of established plants in the pastures was considerably higher. We suggest that the invasion by Bunks orientalis in pastures may be facilitated by vegetative regeneration following root fragmentation by sheep pasturing. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

These results are consistent with the enemy release hypothesis, despite the fact that the herbivore communities in both regions were mainly composed of generalist species. However, in contrast to the prediction of EICA, analysis of anti-grazing compounds indicated a higher allocation to defense in introduced compared to native F. evanescens. The results suggest that the invader is subjected to less intense enemy control in the new range, but that this is due to an increased allocation to defense rather than release from specialized herbivores. This indicates that increased resistance to herbivory might be an important strategy for invasion success in systems dominated by generalist herbivores."

When a plant species is introduced into a new range, it may differentiate genetically from the original populations in the home range. This genetic differentiation may influence the extent to which the invasion of the new range is successful. We tested this hypothesis by examining Senecio pterophorus, a South African shrub that was introduced into NE Spain about 40 years ago. We predicted that in the introduced range invasive populations would perform better and show greater plasticity than native populations. 2. Individuals of S. pterophorus from four Spanish (invasive) and four South African (native) populations were grown in Catalonia, Spain, in a common garden in which disturbance and water availability were manipulated. Fitness traits and several ecophysiological parameters were measured. 3. The invasive populations of S. pterophorus survived better throughout the summer drought in a disturbed (unvegetated) environment than native South African populations. This success may be attributable to the lower specific leaf area (SLA) and better water content regulation of the invasive populations in this treatment. 4. Invasive populations displayed up to three times higher relative growth rate than native populations under conditions of disturbance and non-limiting water availability. 5. The reproductive performance of the invasive populations was higher in all treatments except under the most stressful conditions (i.e. in non-watered undisturbed plots), where no plant from either population flowered. 6. The results for leaf parameters and chlorophyll fluorescence measurements suggested that the greater fitness of the invasive populations could be attributed to more favourable ecophysiological responses. 7. Synthesis. Spanish invasive populations of S. pterophorus performed better in the presence of high levels of disturbance, and displayed higher plasticity of fitness traits in response to resource availability than native South African populations. Our results suggest that genetic differentiation from source populations associated with founding may play a role in invasion success."

We found that invasion of bullfrogs is facilitated by the presence of co-evolved non-native fish, which increase tadpole survival by reducing predatory macroinvertebrate densities. Native dragonfly nymphs in Oregon, USA caused zero survival of bullfrog tadpoles in a replicated field experiment unless a non-native sunfish was present to reduce dragonfly density. This pattern was also evident in pond surveys where the best predictors of bullfrog abundance were the presence of non-native fish and bathymetry. This is the first experimental evidence of facilitation between two non-native vertebrates and supports the invasional meltdown hypothesis. Such positive interactions among non-native species have the potential to disrupt ecosystems by amplifying invasions, and our study shows they can occur via indirect mechanisms."

These patterns are assumed to reflect natural selection via differential predation on genetically determined, fixed phenotypes. Phenotypic variation, however, also can reflect within-generation developmental responses to environmental cues (phenotypic plasticity). For example, water-borne effluents from predators can induce the production of defensive morphologies in many prey taxa. This phenomenon, however, has been examined only on narrow scales. Here, we demonstrate adaptive phenotypic plasticity in prey from geographically separated populations that were reared in the presence of an introduced predator. Marine snails exposed to predatory crab effluent in the field increased shell thickness rapidly compared with controls. Induced changes were comparable to (i) historical transitions in thickness previously attributed to selection by the invading predator and (ii) present-day clinal variation predicted from water temperature differences. Thus, predator-induced phenotypic plasticity may explain broad-scale geographic and temporal phenotypic variation. If inducible defenses are heritable, then selection on the reaction norm may influence coevolution between predator and prey. Trade-offs may explain why inducible rather than constitutive defenses have evolved in several gastropod species."

In the case of the tropical water flea Daphnia lumholtzi, which invaded North America, it has been suggested that this species possesses a high thermal tolerance, which in the course of global climate change promotes its establishment and rapid spread. However, D. lumholtzi has an additional remarkable feature: it is the only water flea that forms rigid head spines in response to chemicals released in the presence of fishes. These morphologically (phenotypically) plastic traits serve as an inducible defence against these predators. Here, we show in controlled mesocosm experiments that the native North American species Daphnia pulicaria is competitively superior to D. lumholtzi in the absence of predators. However, in the presence of fish predation the invasive species formed its defences and became dominant. This observation of a predator-mediated switch in dominance suggests that the inducible defence against fish predation may represent a key adaptation for the invasion success of D. lumholtzi."

The role of propagule pressure relative to disturbance and various environmental factors is, however, difficult to quantify. We explored the relative importance of factors driving invasions using detailed data on the distribution and percentage cover of alien tree species on South Africa's Agulhas Plain (2,160 km(2)). Classification trees based on geology, climate, land use, and topography adequately explained distribution but not abundance (canopy cover) of three widespread invasive species (Acacia cyclops, Acacia saligna, and Pinus pinaster). A semimechanistic model was then developed to quantify the roles of propagule pressure and environmental heterogeneity in structuring invasion patterns. The intensity of propagule pressure (approximated by the distance from putative invasion foci) was a much better predictor of canopy cover than any environmental factor that was considered. The influence of environmental factors was then assessed on the residuals of the first model to determine how propagule pressure interacts with environmental factors. The mediating effect of environmental factors was species specific. Models combining propagule pressure and environmental factors successfully predicted more than 70% of the variation in canopy cover for each species."

Density and cover of non-native species were consistently greatest at the reserve edges, decreasing rapidly with incresing distance from reserve edge. Numbers of native species showed little effect of distance from reserve edge. Fire had no apparent effect on abundance of non-natives in Allocasuarina shrubland but abundance of native plants increased. Density of both non-native and native plants in Acacia acuminata-Eucalyptus loxophleba woodland decreased after fire. Fewer non-native species were found in the shrubland than in the woodland in both unburnt and burnt areas, this difference being smallest between burnt areas. Levels of soil phosphorus and nitrate were higher in burnt areas of both communities and ammonium also increased in the shrubland. Levels of soil phosphorus and nitrate were higher at the reserve edge in the unburnt shrubland, but not in the woodland. There was a strong correlation between soil phosphorus levels and abundance of non-native species in the unburnt shrubland, but not after fire or in the woodland. Removal of non-native plants in the burnt shrubland had a strong positive effect on total abundance of native plants, apparently due to increases in growth of smaller, suppressed native plants in response to decreased competition. Two native species showed increased seed production in plots where non-native plants had been removed. There was a general indication that, in the short term, fire does not necessarily increase invasion of these communities by non-native species and could, therefore be a useful management tool in remnant vegetation, providing other disturbances are minimised."

Cirsium arvense (Californian, Canada, or creeping thistle) is a weed of Eurasian origin that was inadvertently introduced to New Zealand (NZ), where it is presently one of the worst invasive weeds. We tested the 'enemy release hypothesis' (ERH) by establishing natural enemy exclusion plots in both the native (Europe) and introduced (NZ) ranges of C. arvense. We followed the development and fate of individually labelled shoots and recorded recruitment of new shoots into the population over two years. Natural enemy exclusion hadminimal impact on shoot height and relative growth rate in either range. However, natural enemies did have a significant effect on shoot population growth and development in the native range, supporting the ERH. In year one, exclusion of insect herbivores increased mean population growth by 2.1-3.6 shoots m(-2), and in year two exclusion of pathogens increased mean population growth by 2.7-4.1 shoots m(-2). Exclusion of insect herbivores in the native range also increased the probability of shoots developing from the budding to the reproductive growth stage by 4.0x in the first year, and 13.4x in the second year; but exclusion of pathogens had no effect on shoot development in either year. In accordance with the ERH, exclusion of insect herbivores and pathogens did not benefit shoot development or population growth in the introduced range. In either range, we found no evidence for an additive benefit of dual exclusion of insects and pathogens, and in no case was there an interaction between insect and pathogen exclusion. This study further demonstrates the value of conducting manipulative experiments in the native and introduced ranges of an invasive plant to elucidate invasion mechanisms."

Soil cores from earthworm-free areas of northern Alberta, Canada, were inoculated with D. octaedra alone, L terrestris alone, both worm species together, or no earthworms. After 4.5 months, microarthropods were extracted from the soil, counted, and identified to higher taxa. Oribatid mites were further identified to family and genus. Abundance of microarthropods was significantly lower in the treatment containing both species than in the no earthworm treatment and the L terrestris treatment. Oribatida and Prostigmata/Astigmata differed significantly among treatments and were lowest in the treatment containing both earthworm species, followed by the D. octaedra treatment, although post-hoc pairwise comparisons were not significant. Within the Oribatida, composition differed between the control and L terrestris treatments as compared to the D. octaedra and both-species treatments, with Suctobelbella and Tectocepheus in particular having higher abundances in the control treatment. Effects of the two earthworm species on microarthropods were neither synergistic nor antagonistic. Our results indicate that earthworms can have strong effects on microarthropod assemblages in boreal forest soils. Future research should examine whether these changes have cascading effects on nutrient cycling, microbial communities, or plant growth. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

With continued globalization, species are being transported and introduced into novel habitats at an accelerating rate. Interactions between invasive species may provide important mechanisms that moderate their impacts on native species. 2. The European green crab Carcinus maenas is an aggressive predator that was introduced to the east coast of North America in the mid-1800s and is capable of rapid consumption of bivalve prey. A newer invasive predator, the Asian shore crab Hemigrapsus sanguineus, was first discovered on the Atlantic coast in the 1980s, and now inhabits many of the same regions as C. maenas within the Gulf of Maine. Using a series of field and laboratory investigations, we examined the consequences of interactions between these predators. 3. Density patterns of these two species at different spatial scales are consistent with negative interactions. As a result of these interactions, C. maenas alters its diet to consume fewer mussels, its preferred prey, in the presence of H. sanguineus. Decreased mussel consumption in turn leads to lower growth rates for C. maenas, with potential detrimental effects on C. maenas populations. 4. Rather than an invasional meltdown, this study demonstrates that, within the Gulf of Maine, this new invasive predator can moderate the impacts of the older invasive predator."

Family richness and Shannon diversity differed significantly between Woods' rose and Saskatoon, but not between either of these plant types and Russian olive. An abundance of Thripidae (Thysanoptera) on Russian olive and Tingidae (Hemiptera) on Saskatoon contributed to significant compositional differences among plant types.

We observed a total of 25 insect species in 12 families and 6 orders feeding on the six species of Eugenia. Of these insect species, the majority were native (72%), polyphagous (64%), and ectophagous (68%). We found that invasive introduced Eugenia has a similar level of herbivore richness as both the native and the non-invasive introduced Eugenia. However, the numbers and percentages of oligophagous insect species were greatest on the native Eugenia, but they were not different between the invasive and non-invasive introduced Eugenia. One oligophagous endophagous insect has likely shifted from the native to the invasive, but none to the non-invasive Eugenia. In summary, the invasive Eugenia encountered equal, if not greater, herbivore pressure than the non-invasive Eugenia, including from oligophagous and endophagous herbivores. Our data only provided limited support to the ERH. We would not have been able to draw this conclusion without inclusion of the non-invasive Eugenia species in the study."

We conducted a factorial experiment involving herbivore manipulation (insecticide-in-water vs. water-only control) and seven densities of introduced nonnative Cirsium vulgare (bull thistle) seed. The experiment was repeated with two seed cohorts at eight grassland sites uninvaded by C. vulgare in the central Great Plains, USA. Herbivory by native insects significantly reduced thistle seedling density, causing the largest reductions in density at the highest propagule inputs. The magnitude of this herbivore effect varied widely among sites and between cohort years. The combination of herbivory and lower propagule pressure increased the rate at which new C. vulgare populations failed to establish during the initial stages of invasion. This experiment demonstrates that the interaction between biotic resistance by native insects, propagule pressure, and spatiotemporal variation in their effects were crucial to the initial invasion by this Eurasian plant in the western tallgrass prairie."

We describe the assemblage of seed dispersers on three species of alien Opuntia invading Mediterranean and Macaronesian habitats, and examine the quality of such plant-animal interactions. We identified vertebrates consuming O. maxima, O. dillenii and O. stricta fruits by direct observation and collecting droppings and pellets. Phenology of the alien species, as well as that of coexisting native species, was monitored for an entire year. Germination tests of ingested and non-ingested seeds were performed both in the greenhouse and in the field. Seed coat thickness and viability were also measured for all treatments. A great variety of taxa, including reptiles, birds and mammals actively participate in the seed dispersal of Opuntia. Phenology of Opuntia fruits in Menorca and Tenerife overlaps with only a few native fleshy-fruited plants present in the study areas, which suggests an advantage for the invader. Most seeds germinated during the second year of the experiment, independently of the effect produced by the dispersers' guts. We found great variation in the germination percentage of Opuntia after gut passage and in the effects of ingestion on seed coat thickness. Seed viability was somewhat reduced after gut passage compared to manually depulped seeds. Our results show how different Opuntia species are integrated into native communities by means of mutualistic interactions, with both native and alien dispersers. Although with heterogeneous effects, either type of disperser potentially contributes to the spread of these alien cacti in the recipient areas."

It is increasingly recognised that effects of multiple species often cannot be predicted from the effect of each species alone, due to complex interactions, but most investigations of invasion impacts have examined only one non-native species at a time and have not addressed the interactive effects of multiple species. We conducted a field experiment to compare the individual and combined effects of two introduced marine predators, the northern Pacific seastar Asterias amurensis and the European green crab Carcinus maenas, on a soft-sediment invertebrate assemblage in Tasmania. Spatial overlap in the distribution of these invaders is just beginning in Tasmania, and appears imminent as their respective ranges expand, suggesting a strong overlap in food resources will result from the shared proclivity for bivalve prey. A. amurensis and C. maenas provide good models to test the interaction between multiple introduced predators, because they leave clear predator-specific traces of their predatory activity for a number of common prey taxa (bivalves and gastropods). Our experiments demonstrate that both predators had a major effect on the abundance of bivalves, reducing populations of the commercial bivalves Fulvia tenuicostata and Katelysia rhytiphora. The interaction between C. maenas and A. amurensis appears to be one of resource competition, resulting in partitioning of bivalves according to size between predators, with A. amurensis consuming the large and C. maenas the small bivalves. At a large spatial scale, we predict that the combined effect on bivalves may be greater than that due to each predator alone simply because their combined distribution is likely to cover a broader range of habitats. At a smaller scale, in the shallow subtidal, where spatial overlap is expected to be most extensive, our results indicate the individual effects of each predator are likely to be modified in the presence of the other as densities increase. These results further highlight the need to consider the interactive effects of introduced species, especially with continued increases in the number of established invasions."

European green crabs (Carcintus maenas), once common in rocky intertidal habitats of southern New England, have recently declined in abundance coincident with the invasion of the Asian shore crab (Hemigrapsus sanguineus). Over a four-year period in the late 1990s we documented a significant (40-90%) decline in green crab abundance and a sharp (10-fold) increase in H. sanguineus at three sites in southern New England. Small, newly recruited green crabs had a significant risk of predation when paired with larger H. sanguineus in the laboratory, and recruitment of 0-yr C. maenas was reduced by H. sanguineus as well as by larger conspecifics in field-deployed cages (via predation and cannibalism, respectively). In contrast, recruitment of 0-yr H. sanguineus was not affected by larger individuals of either crab species during the same experiments. The differential susceptibility of C. maenas and H. sanguineus recruits to predation and cannibalism likely contributed to the observed decrease in C. maenas abundance and the almost exponential increase in H. sanguineus abundance during the period of study. While the Asian shore crab is primarily restricted to rocky intertidal habitats, C. maenas is found intertidally, subtidally, and in a range of substrate types in New England. Thus, the apparent replacement of C. maenas by H. sanguineus in rocky intertidal habitats of southern New England may not ameliorate the economic and ecological impacts attributed to green crab populations in other habitats of this region. For example, field experiments indicate that predation pressure on a native bivalve species (Mytilus edulis) has not necessarily decreased with the declines of C. maenas. While H. sanguineus has weaker per capita effects than C. mamas, its densities greatly exceed those of C. maenas at present and its population-level effects are likely comparable to the past effects of C. maenas. The Carcinus-Hemigrapsus interactions documented here are relevant in other parts of the world where green crabs and grapsid crabs interact, particularly on the west coast of North America where C mamas has recently invaded and co-occurs with two native Hemigrapsus species."

Evidence suggests that abiotic constraint, propagule pressure, and biotic resistance of resident species each determine plant invasion success, yet their interactions are rarely tested. To understand these interactions, we conducted community assembly experiments simulating situations in which seeds of the invasive grass species Phragmites australis (Poaceae) land on bare soil along with seeds of resident wetland plant species. We used structural equation models to measure both direct abiotic constraint (here moist vs. flooded conditions) on invasion success and indirect constraint on the abundance and, therefore, biotic resistance of resident plant species. We also evaluated how propagule supply of P. australis interacts with the biotic resistance of resident species during invasion. We observed that flooding always directly reduced invasion success but had a synergistic or antagonistic effect on biotic resistance depending on the resident species involved. Biotic resistance of the most diverse resident species mixture remained strong even when abiotic conditions changed. Biotic resistance was also extremely effective under low propagule pressure of the invader. Moreover, the presence of a dense resident plant cover appeared to lower the threshold at which invasion success became stable even when propagule supply increased. Our study not only provides an analytical framework to quantify the effect of multiple interactions relevant to community assembly and species invasion, but it also proposes guidelines for innovative invasion management strategies based on a sound understanding of ecological processes."

A press removal experiment conducted within a deciduous forest understory community indicated that M. vimineum was a superior competitor to L. japonica. We tested the hypothesis that the competitive success of M. vimineum was because it overgrew, and reduced light available to, L. japonica, by conducting a separate light gradient experiment within the same community. Shade cloth that simulated the M. vimineum canopy reduced the performance of L. japonica. In a third complementary experiment, we added experimental support hosts to test the hypothesis that the competitive ability of L. japonica is limited by support hosts, onto which L. japonica climbs to access light. We found that the abundance of climbing branches increased with the number of support hosts. Results of this experiment indicate that these two invasive species compete asymmetrically for resources, particularly light."

The presence of eelgrass reduced water flow by up to 40% and was also observed to retain water at low tide, which may ameliorate desiccation and explain why eelgrass grew faster in the presence of conspecifics (positive feedback). Although shell growth of small (20-50 mm) clams was not consistently affected by either treatment in this 2-month experiment, clam condition improved when eelgrass was removed. Reciprocally, clams at aquaculture densities had no effect on eelgrass growth, clam growth and condition, or porewater nutrients. Overall, only Z. japonica demonstrated strong population-level interactions. Interspecific results support an emerging paradigm that invasive marine ecosystem engineers often negatively affect infauna. Positive feedbacks for Z. japonica may characterize its intraspecific effects particularly at the stressful intertidal elevation of this study (+1 m above mean lower low water)."

Mill) and the invasion by Eurasian earthworms facilitated one another. Using a litterbag approach, we examined mass loss of four substrates (R. cathartica, Acer saccharum, Quercus rubra, and Quercus alba) along a gradient of Eurasian earthworm density and biomass throughout a 40.5 ha oak woodland in Glencoe, Illinois. Earthworm densities and biomass were greatest in patches where R. cathartica prevailed, and populations were lowest in an upland forest subcommunity within the woodland. At each of three points along this earthworm gradient, we placed replicated litterbags constructed either to permit or to deny access to the titter by earthworms. The treatments were, therefore, plot treatments (tow, medium and high earthworm density and biomass) and litterbag treatments (earthworm access and earthworm excluded). We found that earthworms promoted a very rapid loss of litter from R. cathartica bags. Within 3 months greater than 90% of this litter was Lost from the litterbags. Earthworm impacts on other substrates followed the sequence A. saccharum > Q. alba = Q. rubra. Effects of both litterbag and plot treatments were found within 3 months for A. saccharum but Quercus species were affected only after a year. We propose that the impact of earthworms on litter breakdown creates conditions that promote and sustain invasion by R. cathartica. Previous work has demonstrated that R. cathortica may alter soil properties in a way that promotes and sustains invasion by earthworms. These findings have implications for the restoration management of these systems, since the legacy of R. cathartica on soil properties and earthworm populations may persist even after the plant has been physically removed.

Here, we evaluate the individual and interactive effects of resident diversity and resource enrichment on plant community resistance to invasion. We factorially manipulated plant diversity and the enrichment of belowground (soil nitrogen) and aboveground (light) resources in low-fertility grassland communities invaded by Lolium arundinaceum, the most abundant invasive grass in eastern North America. Soil nitrogen enrichment enhanced L. arundinaceum performance, but increased resident diversity dampened this effect of nitrogen enrichment. Increased light availability (via clipping of aboveground vegetation) had a negligible effect on community invasibility. These results demonstrate that a community's susceptibility to invasion can be contingent upon the type of resource pulse and the diversity of resident species. In order to assess the generality of these results, future studies that test the effects of resident diversity and resource enrichment against a range of invasive species and in other environmental contexts (e.g., sites differing in soil fertility and light regimes) are needed. Such studies may help to resolve conflicting interpretations of the diversity-invasibility relationship and provide direction for management strategies."

The Guadiana River is one of the most important rivers in the Iberian Peninsula. The fish fauna presents 11 native freshwater species, including eight with high conservation status. Several exotic species are present, the most important being the American centrarchids pumpkinseed fish and largemouth bass. As a typical mediterranean-type river, the Guadiana has an irregular hydrological regime with severe drought periods and floods; the interannual variation of discharge presents a ratio of c. 100 to 1. From 1980 to 1995 several dry years were observed, culminating in the drought of 1991/92-1994/95. Analysing the variation of the fish assemblage structure during this period, exotic species (mostly pumpkinseed) progressively increased, strongly dominating in 1995. Indigenous populations dramatically decreased and a previously common endemic cyprinid (Anaecypris hispanica Steindachner) became endangered and one of the most threatened fishes of Europe. However, the following years presented above-average flows with several flood events and an inverse process occurred, with native species increasing their contribution in a short period. The importance of floods as a disturbance factor in the control of lentic or slow flowing water exotics is discussed. Native species apparently possess adaptive responses to high flows which exotics lack. This hypothesis is consistent with probability-of-use curves and preflood-postflood surveys. Results emphasize the importance of floods in the environmental flows of mediterranean-type rivers. In the absence of flooding disturbance, exotic fish populations predictably grow, increasing the pressure on native species; abiotic disturbance may supersede deterministic outcomes of predation or competition and influence community structure by reducing populations of the exotic species.

The invasive population acclimated to elevated temperatures through increased rates of photosynthesis (range: P-amb: 8-452 mu mol O-2 g(-1) DM h(-1)) and relative growth rates (range: 0.01-0.05 d(-1)) and associated regulations in the photosynthetic machinery. The non-invasive population had a lower acclimation potential (range: P-amb: 43-173 mu.mol O-2 g(-1) DM h(-1); RGR: 0.01-0.03 d(-1)), but was better at acclimating to cooler conditions by regulation of the light-harvesting complex. Hence, the invasive population of C. demersum from New Zealand had higher phenotypic plasticity in response to temperature than the non-invasive Danish population. This might be the result of genetic evolution since its introduction to New Zealand five decades ago, but further studies are needed to test this hypothesis. The study also indicate, that the global increase in temperature may exacerbate the problems experienced with the invasive C. demersum in New Zealand, as the performance and fitness of this population appear to be favoured at elevated temperatures.

We tested this hypothesis using ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) collected in pitfall traps from sites that varied in time since last disturbance. This successional gradient was embedded in an urban landscape near Montreal, Quebec. We predicted that diversity in young forests and old fields would be higher than in agricultural fields and old forests. Fifty-five species (2932 individuals) were found in 2003 and 46 species (2207 individuals) in 2004. In both years, species richness was highest from traps placed in agricultural fields. We collected nine introduced species; these had higher catch rates than the native species in both years (64.8% of total catch). When introduced species were removed from the Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling ordination analysis, the assemblages from agricultural fields were less distinct compared to those of the other habitats, suggesting the introduced fauna is important in structuring carabid assemblages from the agricultural fields. Introduced species may play a significant role in the community composition of ground beetles in urban landscapes, and their influence may be the cause of the lack of support found for the IDH."

We studied fruit dispersal in a lowland secondary forest near Kaikoura, where the only remaining native frugivores are relatively small (silvereye Zosterops lateralis, and bellbird Anthornis melanura). We tested whether two larger exotic frugivores (blackbird Turdus merula and song thrush T. philomelos) dispersed native plants with seeds too large for the two smaller native frugivores. Diet breadth was measured by identifying seeds in the faeces of 221 mist-netted birds, and by observations of birds foraging. We then compared the plant species dispersed to the range of locally available fruits. All four bird species had varied diets (6-9 plant species per bird species) that differed significantly, although Coprosma robusta was always the most-eaten fruit. As predicted, the maximum fruit size eaten was larger for exotic birds (11.3 mm diameter) than natives (7.4-7.7 mm diameter), but all birds ate mainly smaller fruits. However, 7/21 fruiting plant species were not seen to be dispersed by any species, and the chance of being undispersed was independent of fruit size. Blackbirds and song thrushes jointly dispersed all four woody weeds with fruits >7.5 mm diameter, but neither of the two similar-sized native plants. Although the two species of exotic birds dispersed some native plants, our study suggests that their net effect is negative through facilitating the spread of invasive weeds. Studies evaluating the contribution of exotic frugivores to novel plant communities need to distinguish potential effects (what the frugivores might be capable of doing) from actual effects (what the frugivores are observed doing)."

One factor frequently invoked to explain the invasiveness of exotic species is their release in the new habitat from control by natural enemies (enemy-release hypothesis). More recently, interactions between exotic species have been proposed as a potential mechanism to facilitate invasions (invasional meltdown hypothesis). We studied the effects of introduced deer on native plant communities and exotic plant species on an island in Patagonia, Argentina using five 400 m(2) exclosures paired with control areas in an Austrocedrus chilensis native forest stand. We hypothesized that introduced deer modify native understory composition and abundance and facilitate invasion of introduced tree species that have been widely planted in the region. After 4 years of deer exclusion, native Austrocedrus and exotic Pseudotsuga menziesii tree sapling abundances are not different inside and outside exclosures. However, deer browsing has strongly inhibited growth of native tree saplings (relative height growth is 77% lower with deer present), while exotic tree sapling growth is less affected (relative height growth is 3.3% lower). Deer significantly change abundance and composition of native understory plants. Cover of native plants in exclosures increased while cover in controls remained constant. Understory composition in exclosures after only 4 years differs greatly from that in controls, mainly owing to the abundance of highly-browsed native species. This study shows that introduced deer can aid the invasion of non-native tree species through negatively affecting native plant species."

The search for general characteristics of invasive species has not been very successful yet. A reason for this could be that current invasion patterns are mainly reflecting the introduction history (i.e. time since introduction and propagule pressure) of the species. Accurate data on the introduction history are, however, rare, particularly for introduced alien species that have not established. As a consequence, few studies that tested for the effects of species characteristics on invasiveness corrected for introduction history. 2. We tested whether the naturalization success of 582 North American woody species in Europe, measured as the proportion of European geographic regions in which each species is established, can be explained by their introduction history. For 278 of these species we had data on characteristics related to growth form, life cycle, growth, fecundity and environmental tolerance. We tested whether naturalization success can be further explained by these characteristics. In addition, we tested whether the effects of species characteristics differ between growth forms. 3. Both planting frequency in European gardens and time since introduction significantly increased naturalization success, but the effect of the latter was relatively weak. After correction for introduction history and taxonomy, six of the 26 species characteristics had significant effects on naturalization success. Leaf retention and precipitation tolerance increased naturalization success. Tree species were only 56% as likely to naturalize as non-tree species (vines, shrubs and subshrubs), and the effect of planting frequency on naturalization success was much stronger for non-trees than for trees. On the other hand, the naturalization success of trees, but not for non-trees, increased with native range size, maximum plant height and seed spread rate. 4. Synthesis. Our results suggest that introduction history, particularly planting frequency, is an important determinant of current naturalization success of North American woody species (particularly of non-trees) in Europe. Therefore, studies comparing naturalization success among species should correct for introduction history. Species characteristics are also significant determinants of naturalization success, but their effects may differ between growth forms."

Here, we show that variation in establishment success of nonnative frogs and toads is primarily explained by variation in introduction pathways and climatic similarity between the native range and introduction locality, with minor contributions from phylogeny, species ecology, and life history. This finding contrasts with recent evidence that particular species characteristics promote evolutionary range expansion and reduce the probability of extinction in native populations of amphibians, emphasizing how different mechanisms may shape species distributions on different temporal and spatial scales. We suggest that contemporary changes in the distribution of amphibians will be primarily determined by human-mediated extinctions and movement of species within climatic envelopes, and less by species-typical traits."

The most frequently introduced aquatic species in Europe are freshwater fishes. We describe clear introduction pathways of aquatic species into Europe and three types of country are observed: ""recipient and donor"" (large, midlatitude European countries, such as France, the United Kingdom, and Germany, that give and receive the most introductions), ""recipient"" (most countries, but particularly southern countries, which give few species but receive many), and ""neither recipient nor donor"" (only two countries).

Whilst this can lead to species replacements, co-existence may occur, but we lack knowledge of processes driving such patterns. Since environmental heterogeneity can determine species richness and co-existence, the present study examines habitat use and its mediation of the predatory interaction between invasive aquatic amphipods, the Ponto-Caspian Dikerogammarus villosus and the N. American Gammarus tigrinus. In the Dutch Lake IJsselmeer, we found broad segregation of D. villosus and G. tigrinus by habitat type, the former predominating in the boulder zone and the latter in the soft sediment. However, the two species co-exist in the boulder zone, both on the short and longer terms. We used an experimental simulation of habitat heterogeneity and show that both species utilize crevices, different sized holes in a plastic grid, non-randomly. These amphipods appear to optimise the use of holes with respect to their 'C-shape' body size. When placed together, D. villosus adults preyed on G. tigrinus adults and juveniles, while G. tigrinus adults preyed on D. villosus juveniles. Juveniles were also predators and both species were cannibalistic. However, the impact on G. tigrinus of the superior intraguild predator, D. villosus, was significantly reduced where experimental grids were present as compared to absent. This mitigation of intraguild predation between the two species in complex habitats may explain the co-existence of these two invasive species."

We considered whether mutualism between invasive yellow crazy ant Anoplolepis gracilipes and exotic honeydew-producing scale insects indirectly facilitated land snails (exotic and native) via the removal of a native omnivore, the red land crab Gecarcoidea natalis. In plateau rainforest on Christmas Island, Indian Ocean, the land snail community was surveyed at 28 sites representing four forest states that differed in the density of red crabs, the abundance of yellow crazy ants and management history. One-way ANOVAs and multivariate analyses were used to determine differences in land snail species abundance and composition between forest states. Sample-based rarefaction was used to determine differences in species richness. The removal of the red land crab by supercolonies of yellow crazy ants was associated with a significant increase in the abundance of both invasive (14 species) and native (four species) land snails. Compositional differences in the land snail community were driven most strongly by the significantly greater abundance of a few common species in forest states devoid of red crabs. In forest where the crab population had recovered following management for ants, the land snail assemblage did not differ from intact, uninvaded forest. The land snail community was dominated by exotic species that can coexist alongside red crabs in rainforest uninvaded by exotic ants and scale insects. However, the ant-scale mutualism significantly increased land snail abundance and altered their composition indirectly though the alteration of the recipient community. We suggest these constitute 'population-release' secondary invasion in which the impacts of previously successful invaders facilitate a significant increase in abundance of other exotic species already established at low density within the community. Understanding facilitative interactions between invaders and indirect consequences of impacts will provide invaluable insights for conservation in heavily invaded ecosystems."

We quantified the individual and net importance of distance from areas of human disturbance, native plant diversity, and environmental gradients in determining exotic plant establishment. Distance from disturbed areas, both within and around the reserve, was not correlated to exotic species richness. Numbers of native and exotic species were positively correlated at large (50 m(2)) and small (10 m(2)) plot sizes, a trend that persisted when relationships to environmental gradients were controlled statistically. Both native and exotic species richness increased with soil pH and decreased along a gradient of increasing nitrate availability. Exotic species were restricted to the upper portion of the pH gradient and had individualistic responses to the availability of soil resources. These results are inconsistent with both the diversity-resistance and resource-enrichment hypotheses for invasibility. Environmental conditions favoring native species richness also favor exotic species richness, and competitive interactions with the native flora do not appear to limit the entry of additional species into the understory community at this site. It appears that exotic species with niche requirements poorly represented in the regional flora of native species may establish with relatively little resistance or consequence for native species richness."

Invasibility was evaluated by sowing seeds of 34 plant species into 40 experimental plots and then measuring colonization success after two growing seasons. Compositional stability, defined as resistance to change in species relative abundances over two growing seasons and in response to experimental disturbance, was measured in a separate set of 40 plots. We found that community susceptibility to invasion was greatest in high diversity microsites within this grassland. Multiple regression analyses suggested that the positive correlation between invasibility and plant diversity was due to the direct influences of the extrinsic factors that contribute to spatial variation in diversity (soil disturbances; light availability), not to any direct impact of diversity. In addition, we found that compositional stability in response to disturbance was greatest within low diversity microsites and was strongly related to the dominance (evenness) component of diversity."

The mechanisms that make communities resistant to invasions and drive the establishment success of seedlings are essential both for management and for understanding community assembly and structure. Especially in grasslands, anecic earthworms are known to function as ecosystem engineers, however, their direct effects on plant community composition and on the invasibility of plant communities via plant seed burial, ingestion and digestion are poorly understood. In a greenhouse experiment we investigated the impact of Lumbricus terrestris, plant functional group identity and seed size of plant invader species and plant functional group of the established plant community on the number and biomass of plant invaders. We set up 120 microcosms comprising four plant community treatments, two earthworm treatments and three plant invader treatments containing three seed size classes. Earthworm performance was influenced by an interaction between plant functional group identity of the established plant community and that of invader species. The established plant community and invader seed size affected the number of invader plants significantly, while invader biomass was only affected by the established community. Since earthworm effects on the number and biomass of invader plants varied with seed size and plant functional group identity they probably play a key role in seedling establishment and plant community composition. Seeds and germinating seedlings in earthworm burrows may significantly contribute to earthworm nutrition, but this deserves further attention. Lumbricus terrestris likely behaves like a 'farmer' by collecting plant seeds which cannot directly be swallowed or digested. Presumably, these seeds are left in middens and become eatable after partial microbial decay. Increased earthworm numbers in more diverse plant communities likely contribute to the positive relationship between plant species diversity and resistance against invaders."

Current ecological research suggests that invasion success may be determined by properties of the native ecosystem, such as the supply rate of limiting nutrients (i.e. trophic state). We examined how trophic state influences invasion success by introducing an exotic zooplankter, Daphnia lumholtzi into native plankton communities in a series of experimental mesocosms exposed to a strong nutrient gradient. We predicted that the attributes of nutrient-enriched communities would increase the likelihood of a successful invasion attempt by D. lumholtzi. Contrary to our original predictions, we found that D. lumholtzi was often absent from mesocosms that developed under high nutrient supply rates. Instead, the presence of D. lumholtzi was associated with systems that had low nutrients, low zooplankton biomass, and high zooplankton species diversity. Using generalized estimating equations (GEE) and multivariate species data, we found that the presence-absence of D. lumholtzi could be explained by variations in zooplankton community structure, which was itself strongly influenced by nutrient supply rate. We argue that the apparent invasion success of D. luinholtzi was inhibited by the dominance of another cladoceran species, Chlydorus sphaericus. These results suggest that the interaction between trophic state and species identity influenced the invasion success of introduced D. lumholtzi."

When such species alter ecosystem processes, they have the potential to change the environmental context in which other species survive and reproduce and may also facilitate the invasion of additional species. We describe impacts of an invasive N2-fixing tree, Falcataria moluccana, on some of the last intact remnants of native wet lowland forest undergoing primary succession on 48-, 213-, and 300-yr-old lava flows of Kilauea Volcano on the island of Hawai'i. We measured litterfall, soil nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) availability, light availability, species composition, and forest structure in native-dominated stands and in stands invaded by Falcataria. Litter inputs increased 1.3-8.6 times, N mass of litterfall increased 4-55 times, and P mass of litterfall increased 2-28 times in invaded stands relative to native stands. C:N and C:P ratios of litterfall were lower, and N:P ratios higher, in invaded stands relative to native stands. Resin-captured soil N and P values were 17-121 and 2-24 times greater, respectively, in invaded stands relative to native stands on each of the three lava flows. Native species accounted for nearly 100% of total basal area and stem density in native stands, while alien species accounted for 68- 99% of total basal area, and 82-91% of total stem density, in invaded stands. Compositional changes following Falcataria invasion were due both to increases in alien species, particularly Psidium cattleianum, and decreases in native species, particularly Metrosideros polymorpha. Results provide a clear example of how invasive tree species, by modifying the function and structure of the ecosystems that they invade, can facilitate invasion by additional nonnative species and eliminate dominant native species. Given the rarity and limited extent of remaining native-dominated wet lowland forests in Hawaii, and the degree to which Falcataria invasion alters them, we expect that the continued existence of these unique ecosystems will be determined, in large part, by the spread of this invasive species."

Site conditions were expressed indirectly using Ellenberg indicator values. The hypothesis tested was that Heracleum spreads in the majority of vegetation types regardless of the properties of the recipient vegetation. Community invasibility appeared to be affected by site conditions and the composition of the recipient vegetation. The species is not found in acidic habitats. Disturbed habitats with good possibilities of dispersal for Heracleum seeds are more easily invaded. Communities with a higher proportion of phanerophytes and of species with CS (Competitive/Stress-tolerating) strategy were more resistant to invasion. The invasion success was bigger in sites with increased possibilities of spread for Heracleum diaspores. Communities invaded by Heracleum had a lower species diversity and a higher indicator value for nitrogen than not-invaded stands. It appears that species contributing to community resistance against invasion of Heracleum, or capable of persisting in Heracleum-invaded stands, have similar ecological requirements but a different life strategy to the invader."

Native richness was positively correlated with non-native richness, but was usually negatively correlated with non-native abundance, and these patterns were stronger at the larger spatial scale. Logistic regressions indicated that the probability of invasion was reduced both within and following years with high productivity, except at the desert grassland site where high productivity was associated with increased invasion.

We investigated the effects of fragment size, native plant species diversity, and location on invasion by exotic plant species at 25 tallgrass prairie sites in central North America at various geographic scales. We used exotic species richness and relative cover as measures of invasion. Exotic species richness and cover were not related to area for all sites considered together. There were no significant relationships between native species richness and exotic species richness at the cluster and regional scale or for all sites considered together. At the local scale, exotic species richness was positively related to native species richness at four sites and negatively related at one. The 10 most frequently occurring and abundant exotic plant species in the prairie fragments were cool-season, or C-3, species, in contrast to the native plant community, which was dominated by warm-season, or C-4, species. This suggests that timing is important to the success of exotic species in the tallgrass prairie. Our study indicates that some small fragments of tallgrass prairie are relatively intact and should not be overlooked as long-term refuges for prairie species, sources of genetic variability, and material for restoration."

Linkage level, i.e. number of species interactions per species, was significantly higher for endemic species than for non-endemic native and introduced species. Linkage levels of the two latter categories were similar. Nine types of interaction may be recognized among endemic, non-endemic native and introduced plants and pollinators. Similar types had similar frequencies in the two networks. Specifically, we looked for the presence of 'invader complexes' of mutualists, defined as groups of introduced species interacting more with each other than expected by chance and thus facilitating each other's establishment. On both islands, observed frequencies of interactions between native (endemic and non-endemic) and introduced pollinators and plants differed from random. Introduced pollinators and plants interacted less than expected by chance. Thus, the data did not support the existence of invader complexes. Instead, our study suggested that endemic super-generalist species, i.e. pollinators or plant species with a very wide pollination niche, include new invaders in their set of food plants or pollinators and thereby improve establishment success of the invaders. Reviewing other studies, super generalists seem to be a widespread island phenomenon, i.e. island pollination networks include one or a few species with a very high generalization level compared to co-occurring species. Low density of island species may lead to low interspecific competition, high abundance and ultimately wide niches and super generalization."

We therefore examined the distribution of L. hasseltii in sand dune ecosystems and its potential impacts on other animals. In addition, we surveyed the occurrence of spiders on the exotic yucca Yucca gloriosa L. (Asparagaceae), another invader of sand dune ecosystems. Latrodectus hasseltii was observed in six of 18 sand dunes in the Chita Peninsula, central Japan, and was the dominant web-building spider at one site. The web contents of L. hasseltii consisted of various arthropod species, including the threatened ground beetle Scarites sulcatus Olivier (Carabidae). In all, 24 of 172 patches of exotic yucca were occupied by L. hasseltii, suggesting that colonization by exotic plants may facilitate the invasion of L. hasseltii into sand dunes. This is the first report of the invasion of L. hasseltii into semi-natural habitats in Japan, and these results suggest that L. hasseltii poses a threat to the conservation of coastal insects inhabiting human-modified sand dune ecosystems."

Almost half of these species are tunicates, and all but one still occur only in PEI. Recent introductions include Styela clava Herdman in 1997, Botryllus schlosseri (Pallas) in 2001, Botrylloides violaceus Oka in 2002, and Ciona intestinalis (Linnaeus) in 2004. The goal of this paper was to investigate which characteristics of PEI estuaries may have resulted in their being more susceptible to tunicate invasions than estuaries elsewhere in the sGSL. At least one genus that recently established viable populations in PEI was previously introduced to the Gulf of St. Lawrence, apparently without establishing permanent populations. This implies that either propagule pressure has increased or environmental factors are more conducive to establishment now than they were previously. The fluctuating resource availability model predicts increased invasibility of environments that experience pulses of resources such as space or nutrients. Intense development of both agriculture and aquaculture in PEI, and high population density compared to other areas of the sGSL, are associated with high and fluctuating estuarine nutrient levels and a large surface area of artificial substrates (mussel socks) that is kept relatively free of competitors, and is replaced regularly. Changes in nutrient loading and the development of aquaculture have also occurred within the past two to three decades. The provision of artificial structure is likely a critical factor in the successful establishment of tunicates in PEI, because natural hard substrates are scarce. Facilitation by green crabs (Carcinus maenas L.) may be a contributing factor in the spread of Styela. Only one estuary lacking green crabs has an established population of Styela, and at least two known inoculations of Styela into estuaries without green crabs have failed. A likely mechanism for facilitation is the consumption by green crab of the snail Astyris lunata, a known Styela predator. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Community interactions link eachspecies' dynamics so that the colonization of one species may cause the extinction of another. In this way, communityinteractions may set limits to the invadability of an island and to the likelihood of resident species extinctions uponinvasion. To examine the nature of these limits, I assemble stable multi-species Lotka-Volterra competition communities thatdiffer in resident species number and the average strength (and variance) of species interactions. These are then invaded withspecies whose properties are drawn from the same distribution as the residents. The invader success rate and the extinctionrate of resident species is determined as a function of community- and species-level properties. I show that the probabilityof colonization success for an invader decreases with species number and the strength and variance of interspecificinteractions. Communities comprised of many strongly interacting species limit the invasion possibilities of competingspecies. Community interactions, even for a superior invading competitor, set up a sort of ""activation barrier""that repels the invader. This ""priority effect"" for residents is not assumed a priori in mydescription for the individual population dynamics of these species, rather it arises because species-rich andstrongly-interacting species sets have alternative stable states that tend to disfavour species at low densities. These modelspoint to community-level rather than invader-level properties as the strongest determinant of differences in invasion success.If an invading species is successful it competitively displaces a greater number of resident species, on average, as communitysize increases. These results provide a logical framework for an island-biogeographic theory based on species interactions andinvasions and for the protection of fragile native species from invading exotics."

For clonal plants, however, phenotypic plasticity may be equally important. Here the primary adaptive strategy in three non-native, clonally reproducing macrophytes (Egeria densa, Elodea canadensis and Lagarosiphon major) in New Zealand freshwaters were examined and an attempt was made to link observed differences in plant morphology to local variation in habitat conditions. Field populations with a large phenotypic variety were sampled in a range of lakes and streams with different chemical and physical properties. The phenotypic plasticity of the species before and after cultivation was studied in a common garden growth experiment, and the genetic diversity of these same populations was also quantified. For all three species, greater variation in plant characteristics was found before they were grown in standardized conditions. Moreover, field populations displayed remarkably little genetic variation and there was little interaction between habitat conditions and plant morphological characteristics. The results indicate that at the current stage of spread into New Zealand, the primary adaptive strategy of these three invasive macrophytes is phenotypic plasticity. However, while limited, the possibility that genetic diversity between populations may facilitate ecotypic differentiation in the future cannot be excluded. These results thus indicate that invasive clonal aquatic plants adapt to new introduced areas by phenotypic plasticity. Inorganic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous were important in controlling plant size of E. canadensis and L. major, but no other relationships between plant characteristics and habitat conditions were apparent. This implies that within-species differences in plant size can be explained by local nutrient conditions. All together this strongly suggests that invasive clonal aquatic plants adapt to a wide range of habitats in introduced areas by phenotypic plasticity rather than local adaptation."

We test this hypothesis and explore its implications for the restoration of native ecosystems in one of the most dramatic ecological invasions worldwide, the replacement of native perennial grasses by exotic annual grasses and forbs in 9.2 million hectares of California grasslands. The long-term persistence of these exotic annuals has been thought to imply that the exotics are superior competitors. However, seed-addition experiments in a southern California grassland revealed that native perennial species, which had lower requirements for deep soil water, soil nitrate, and light, were strong competitors, and they markedly depressed the abundance and fecundity of exotic annuals after overcoming recruitment limitations. Native species reinvaded exotic grasslands across experimentally imposed nitrogen, water, and disturbance gradients. Thus, exotic annuals are not superior competitors but rather may dominate because of prior disturbance and the low dispersal abilities and extreme current rarity of native perennials. If our results prove to be general, it may be feasible to restore native California grassland flora to at least parts of its former range."

In doing so, crazy ants indirectly release seedling recruitment, enhance species richness of seedlings, and slow litter breakdown. In the forest canopy, new associations between this invasive ant and honeydew-secreting scale insects accelerate and diversify impacts. Sustained high densities of foraging ants on canopy trees result in high population densities of host-generalist scale insects and growth of sooty moulds, leading to canopy dieback and even deaths of canopy trees.

The effect of multiple invaders can be superadditive (invasional meltdown), additive, or subadditive (invasional interference); which of these situations occurs has critical implications for prioritization of management efforts. Carduus nutans and C. acanthoides, two congeneric invasive weeds, have a striking, segregated distribution in central Pennsylvania, U.S.A. Possible hypotheses for this pattern include invasion history and chance, direct competition, or negative interactions mediated by other species, such as shared pollinators. To explore the role of resource competition in generating this pattern, we conducted three related experiments using a response-surface design throughout the life cycles of two cohorts. Although these species have similar niche requirements, we found no differential response to competition between conspecifics vs. congeners. The response to combined density was relatively weak for both species. While direct competitive interactions do not explain the segregated distributional patterns of these two species, we predict that invasions of either species singly, or both species together, would have similar impacts. When prioritizing which areas to target to prevent the spread of one of the species, it is better to focus on areas as yet unaffected by its congener; where the congener is already present, invasional interference makes it unlikely that the net effect will change."

Invader-invader interactions may affect the success of further invaders by altering attributes of recipient communities and propagule pressure. The invasional meltdown hypothesis (IMH) posits that positive interactions among invaders initiate positive population-level feedback that intensifies impacts and promotes secondary invasions. IMH remains controversial: few studies show feedback between invaders that amplifies their effects, and none yet demonstrate facilitation of entry and spread of secondary invaders. Our results show that supercolonies of an alien ant, promoted by mutualism with introduced honeydew-secreting scale insects, permitted invasion by an exotic land snail on Christmas Island, Indian Ocean. Modeling of land snail spread over 750 sites across 135 km 2 over seven years showed that the probability of land snail invasion was facilitated 253-fold in ant supercolonies but impeded in intact forest where predaceous native land crabs remained abundant. Land snail occurrence at neighboring sites, a measure of propagule pressure, also promoted land snail spread. Site comparisons and experiments revealed that ant supercolonies, by killing land crabs but not land snails, disrupted biotic resistance and provided enemy-free space. Predation pressure on land snails was lower (28.6%), survival 115 times longer, and abundance 20-fold greater in supercolonies than in intact forest. Whole-ecosystem suppression of supercolonies reversed the probability of land snail invasion by allowing recolonization of land crabs; land snails were much less likely (0.79%) to invade sites where supercolonies were suppressed than where they remained intact. Our results provide strong empirical evidence for IMH by demonstrating that mutualism between invaders reconfigures key interactions in the recipient community. This facilitates entry of secondary invaders and elevates propagule pressure, propagating their spread at the whole-ecosystem level. We show that identification and management of key facilitative interactions in invaded ecosystems can be used to reverse impacts and restore resistance to further invasions."

While banana passionfruit is partially self-compatible, fruit set was significantly reduced in hand-selfed flowers (17.5%) compared with crossed flowers (29.5%), and we found significant pollen limitation (hand-crossed vs unmanipulated, Pollen Limitation Index = 0.39). There was no significant inbreeding depression found in fruit size, seeds per fruit, germination success, seedling growth or seedling survival. Combining these data showed that natural unmanipulated flowers produce more seedlings per flower (1.7) than bagged flowers (0.9), but fewer than hand-selfed (3.0) and hand-crossed (5.3) flowers. Thus, reproduction in Passiflora tripartita var. mollissima is facilitated by an (imperfect) new association with exotic bees."

In order to test LERH, we compared invasive Eupatorium adenophorum with two native congeners (E. heterophyllum and E. japonicum) in terms of damage by leaf enemies at two natural field sites and two manipulated sites. We also determined enemy impact on carbon assimilation at two manipulated sites. In each site, E. adenophorum was only damaged by herbivores, while in native congeners, leaf scabs or (and) leaf rolls was found in addition to herbivory damage. In both manipulated sites, the total enemy impact on carbon assimilation was lower for E. adenophorum than for native congeners; this observation was consistent with LERH. The results of this study indicate that a short co-existence time with generalist enemies (behavior constraint) might be the main contributor to the lower enemy impact on E. adenophorum."

We examined willingness to eat fruits of selected invasive plants and to select a novel food by measuring the time elapsed before feeding began. Both species demonstrated significant preferences for invasive fruits over similar native fruits in two of three choice tests. Both starlings and robins ate autumn olive (Elaeagnus umbellata) fruits significantly more willingly than Asiatic bittersweet (Celastrus orbiculatus). Starlings, but not robins when choosing between a novel and a familiar food, strongly preferred the familiar food. We found no differences in willingness of birds to eat a novel food when it was the only food available.

While ant and Hemiptera interactions with native plants have been well studied, the effects of invasive ant-scale insect mutualisms on the reproductive output of invasive weeds have not. The study system consisted of Argentine ants (Linepithema humile), boneseed (Chrysanthemoides monilifera monilifera), and sap-sucking scale insects (Hemiptera: Saissetia oleae and Parasaissetia nigra), all of which are invasive in New Zealand. We examined the direct and indirect effects of Argentine ants on scale insects and other invertebrates (especially herbivores) and on plant reproductive output. Argentine ants spent one-third of their time specifically associated with scale insects in tending behaviours. The invertebrate community was significantly different between uninfested and infested plants, with fewer predators and herbivores on ant-infested plants. Herbivore damage was significantly reduced on plants with Argentine ants, but sooty mould colonisation was greater where ants were present. Herbivore damage increased when ants were excluded from plants. Boneseed plants infested with Argentine ants produced significantly more fruits than plants without ants. The increase in reproductive output in the presence of ants may be due to increased pollination as the result of pollinators being forced to relocate frequently to avoid attack by ants, resulting in an increase in pollen transfer and higher fruit/seed set. The consequences of Argentine ant invasion can be varied; not only does their invasion have consequences for maintaining biodiversity, ant invasion may also affect weed and pest management strategies."

We found increased diversity of leaf species, particularly invasive species, in areas further from the urbanized coast, and a significant positive association between the presence of Schinus terebinthifolious (Brazilian pepper) and the abundance of A. albopictus. In laboratory experiments, we determined that larval growth and survivorship were significantly affected by both larval density and leaf species which, in turn, resulted in higher population performance on the most abundant invasive species (Brazilian pepper) relative to the most abundant native species, Quercus virginiana (live oak). These results suggest invasive leaf species can alleviate density dependent reductions in population performance in A. albopictus, and may contribute to its invasion success and potential to spread infectious disease."

Evolution of introduced populations could be the result of founder effects, drift, hybridization, or adaptation to local conditions, which could enhance the invasiveness of introduced species. However, understanding whether the success of invading populations is due to genetic differences between native and introduced populations may be obscured by origin 3 environment interactions. That is, studies conducted under a limited set of environmental conditions may show inconsistent results if native or introduced populations are differentially adapted to specific conditions. We tested for genetic differences between native and introduced populations, and for origin 3 environment interactions, between native (China) and introduced (U. S.) populations of the invasive annual grass Microstegium vimineum (stiltgrass) across 22 common gardens spanning a wide range of habitats and environmental conditions. On average, introduced populations produced 46% greater biomass and had 7.4% greater survival, and outperformed native range populations in every common garden. However, we found no evidence that introduced Microstegium exhibited greater phenotypic plasticity than native populations. Biomass of Microstegium was positively correlated with light and resident community richness and biomass across the common gardens. However, these relationships were equivalent for native and introduced populations, suggesting that the greater mean performance of introduced populations is not due to unequal responses to specific environmental parameters. Our data on performance of invasive and native populations suggest that post-introduction evolutionary changes may have enhanced the invasive potential of this species. Further, the ability of Microstegium to survive and grow across the wide variety of environmental conditions demonstrates that few habitats are immune to invasion."

Using multivariate techniques, we examined the structure of a plant-pollinator web comprising both alien and native plants and flower visitors in the temperate forests of north-west Patagonia, Argentina. Our main objective was to assess whether plant species origin (alien or native) influences the composition of flower visitor assemblages. We also examined the influence of other potential confounding intrinsic factors such as flower symmetry and colour, and extrinsic factors such as flowering time, site and habitat disturbance. 2 Flowers of alien and native plant species were visited by a similar number of species and proportion of insects from different orders, but the composition of the assemblages of flower-visiting species differed between alien and native plants. 3 The influence of plant species origin on the composition of flower visitor assemblages persisted after accounting for other significant factors such as flowering time, bearing red corollas, and habitat disturbance. This influence was at least in part determined by the fact that alien flower visitors were more closely associated with alien plants than with native plants. The main native flower visitors were, on average, equally associated with native and alien plant species. 4 In spite of representing a minor fraction of total species richness (3.6% of all species), alien flower visitors accounted for > 20% of all individuals recorded on flowers. Thus, their high abundance could have a significant impact in terms of pollination. 5 The mutualistic web of alien plants and flower-visiting insects is well integrated into the overall community-wide pollination web. However, in addition to their use of the native biota, invasive plants and flower visitors may benefit from differential interactions with their alien partners. The existence of these invader complexes could contribute to the spread of aliens into novel environments."

Our study documents a case whereby an invasive parasite has remained patchily distributed for decades due to the fragmented nature of available hosts; but the recent arrival of a broadly distributed alternative invasive host species provides an opportunity for the parasite to expand its range considerably. At least 20 years ago, endoparasitic pentastomids (Raillietiella frenata) were brought with their native host, the invasive Asian house gecko Hemidactylus frenatus, to the port city of Darwin in tropical Australia. These geckos rarely disperse away from human habitation, restricting the transmission of their parasites to urban environments - and thus, their pentastomids have remained patchily distributed and have only been recorded in scant localities, primarily surrounding Darwin. The recent range expansion of the invasive cane toad Rhinella marina into the Darwin area has provided an alternative host for this pentastomid. Our results show that the cane toad is a competent host for Ra. frenata- toads shed fully embryonated pentastomid eggs in their faeces - and that pentastomids are now common in cane toads near Darwin. Likely reflecting the tendency for the parasite's traditional definitive host (the Asian house gecko) and only known intermediate host (the cockroach) to reside around buildings, we found the prevalence of this parasite follows an urban distribution. Because cane toads are widely distributed through urban and rural habitat and can shed viable pentastomid eggs, the toad invasion is likely to facilitate the parasite's spread across the tropics, into areas (and additional susceptible hosts) that were previously inaccessible to it."

Arthropod species richness, abundance, species assemblage composition and measures of beta-diversity were assessed between these two legume species where they grow sympatrically. Except for spiders and ants, arthropod species richness did not differ significantly between the two tree taxa. The overall abundance of arthropods was, however, significantly higher on the native tree species. This pattern was strongly driven by herbivores, as is consistent with predictions of the Enemy Release Hypothesis. When excluding rare taxa, over 75 % of all arthropod species collected in this study were associated with both host trees. However, arthropod community composition differed significantly between the two host plant taxa, largely due to differences between their herbivore communities. Arthropod beta diversity was high on the native host, with arthropod communities on the invasive host being much more homogenous across the sampling range. These results indicate that there are numerous exchanges of arthropods between these native and invasive plants. The invasive plant may provide arthropods with a pathway to other habitats between previously isolated native populations. This will have significant implications for biodiversity conservation at the habitat, species and population level."

Although the strength of these inhibitory effects, measured as soil feedbacks, has been assessed between natives and exotics in non-native ranges, few studies have compared the strength of plant-soil feedbacks for exotic species in soils from non-native versus native ranges. We examined whether 6 perennial European forb species that are widespread invaders in North American grasslands (Centaurea stoebe, Euphorbia esula, Hypericum perforatum, Linaria vulgaris, Potentilla recta and Leucanthemum vulgare) experienced different suppressive effects of soil biota collected from 21 sites across both ranges. Four of the six species tested exhibited substantially reduced shoot biomass in live' versus sterile soil from Europe. In contrast, North American soils produced no significant feedbacks on any of the invasive species tested indicating a broad scale escape from the inhibitory effects of soil biota. Negative feedbacks generated by European soil varied idiosyncratically among sites and species. Since this variation did not correspond with the presence of the target species at field sites, it suggests that negative feedbacks can be generated from soil biota that are widely distributed in native ranges in the absence of density-dependent effects.Synthesis. Our results show that for some invasives, native soils have strong suppressive potential, whereas this is not the case in soils from across the introduced range. Differences in regional-scale evolutionary history among plants and soil biota could ultimately help explain why some exotics are able to occur at higher abundance in the introduced versus native range."

In this study, we investigate the effect of the invader Scotch broom (Cytisus scoparius) on the visitation, pollen deposition, and female reproductive output of three co-flowering species (two native, one exotic) of the critically endangered Garry oak grassland ecosystem on the Saanich peninsula of Vancouver Island. The presence of C. scoparius was largely neutral, with the exception of some facilitation of pollen deposition to the native Camassia leichtlinii, the one species exhibiting pollinator overlap with Scotch broom. Yet, this pattern occurred despite a decreased visitation rate from pollinators. There was little observed effect of the invader on the native Collinsia parviflora or the exotic Geranium molle. Because broom was not favourited by any of the observed pollinators, this study provides evidence that the spread of Scotch broom is not due to the reduction of pollination success of natives nor is C. scoparius likely to be facilitating the pollination of other exotics in Garry oak ecosystem remnants."

In addition to the risk of exotic pathogen transmission, other mechanisms such as parasite-release, could contribute to shaping the relationship between introduced species and native communities. In this study, we used the Eurasian round goby (Neogobius menalostomus) in the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River ecosystem to further explore these ideas. As predicted by the parasite-release hypothesis, recently established populations of round goby were parasitized by a depauperate community of generalist helminths (8 taxa), all commonly found in the St. Lawrence River. In comparison, two native species, the logperch (Percina caprodes) and spottail shiner (Notropis hudsonius), were the hosts of 25 and 24 taxa respectively. Round gobies from each of 3 sampled localities were also less heavily infected than both indigenous species. This is in contrast to what is observed in round goby's native range where the species is often the most parasitized among gobid competitors. This relative difference in parasite pressure could enhance its competitiveness in the introduced range. However, our study of an older population of round goby in Lake St. Clair suggests that this advantage over native species could be of short duration. Within 15 years, the parasite abundance and richness in the round goby has more than doubled whereas the number of parasite species per fish has increased to levels of those typical of fish indigenous to the St. Lawrence-Great Lakes watershed."

However, there is a lack of information about how this tolerance influences invasiveness of exotic species in ecosystems with seasonal drought. To address this question for Mediterranean-type ecosystems (MTE) of the Iberian Peninsula, we carried out an experiment with fifteen phylogenetically related species (8 invasive and 7 native, Pinus pinaster Ait., Pinus radiata D. Don, Schinus molle Linn., Elaeagnus angustifolia L. Eucalyptus globulus Labill., Acacia melanoxylon R. Br., Gleditsia triacanthos L. Pistacia terebinthus L., Rhamnus alaternus L., Anagyris foetid L, Colutea arborescens L., Oenothera biennis L., Epilobium hirsutum L. Achille filipendulina Lam. and Achillea millefolium L). Seedlings were grown and maximal photochemical efficiency of PSII (F-v/F-m) was measured at two water availabilities (well-watered and with water stress). PSII thermal tolerance measurements were related to specific leaf area (SLA), which varied significantly across the study species, and to the mean potential evapotranspiration (PET) of the month with the lowest precipitation in the native areas of both groups and in the invaded area of the Iberian Peninsula. Additionally, PSII thermal tolerance measurements under water stress were phylogenetically explored. Invasive and native species neither differed in SLA nor in their thermal tolerance under well-watered conditions. For well-watered plants. SLA was significantly and positively related to PSII thermal tolerance when all species were explored together regardless of their invasive nature. However, this relationship did not persist under water stress and invasive species had higher plastic responses than Mediterranean natives resulting in higher leaf temperatures. Higher PSII thermal tolerance could explain invasiveness because it allows for longer periods of carbon acquisition under water stress. In fact, PSII thermal tolerance was positively related to the PET of the invaded and native areas of the Iberian Peninsula. PSII thermal tolerance was not related to PET at the native range of the invasive species, suggesting that successful invasive species were plastic enough to cope with novel dry conditions of the Iberian Peninsula. Moreover, our phylogenetic results indicate that future scenarios of increased aridity in MTE associated to climate change will filter invasion success by taxonomic identity. This study reveals the importance of studying ecophysiological traits to understand and better predict future biological invasions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

These interactions can have important implications on the invasion process, potentially determining whether NIS become widespread and abundant, survive in small numbers, or fail to establish and disappear. Although many studies have naturally focused on the interactions between NIS and native species to examine their effects and the biological resistance of the recipient community to invasion, few have examined the effects that NIS have on each other. In some cases, interactions can facilitate the invasion process of one or both species (i.e., ""invasional meltdowns""), but competition or predation can lead to negative interactions as well. The introduction of the vase tunicate, Ciona intestinalis, in Prince Edward Island (Canada) has harmed mussel aquaculture via heavy biofouling of equipment and mussels. Through both a broad-scale survey and small-scale field experiments, we show that Ciona recruitment is drastically reduced by caprellid amphipods, including the NIS Caprella mutica. This study provides an exciting example of how established invasive species can negatively impact the recruitment of a secondary invader, highlighting the potential for non-additive effects of multiple invasions."

We have previously shown that network analyses are powerful tools for understanding the effects of exotic species perturbation on ecosystems. We now use the network analysis approach to compare how the same perturbation affects another ecosystem of similar trophic status. We compared food web characteristics of the Bay of Quinte, Lake Ontario (Canada), to previous research on Oneida Lake, New York (USA) before and after zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) invasion. We used ecological network analysis (ENA) to rigorously quantify ecosystem function through an analysis of direct and indirect food web transfers. We used a social network analysis method. cohesion analysis (CA), to assess ecosystem structure by organizing food web members into subgroups of strongly interacting predators and prey. Together, ENA and CA allowed us to understand how food web structure and function respond simultaneously to perturbation. In general, zebra mussel effects on the Bay of Quinte, when compared to Oneida Lake, were similar in direction, but greater in magnitude. Both systems underwent functional changes involving focused flow through a small number of taxa and increased use of benthic sources of production; additionally, both systems structurally changed with subgroup membership changing considerably (33% in Oneida Lake) or being disrupted entirely (in the Bay of Quinte). However, the response of total ecosystem activity (as measured by carbon flow) differed between both systems, with increasing activity in the Bay of Quinte, and decreasing activity in Oneida Lake. Thus, these analyses revealed parallel effects of zebra mussel invasion in ecosystems of similar trophic status, yet they also suggested that important differences may exist. As exotic species continue to disrupt the structure and function of our native ecosystems, food web network analyses will be useful for understanding their far-reaching effects.

The global spread of non-native species is a major concern for ecologists, particularly in regards to aquatic systems. Predicting the characteristics of successful invaders has been a goal of invasion biology for decades. Quantitative analysis of species characteristics may allow invasive species profiling and assist the development of risk assessment strategies. 2. In the current analysis we developed a data base on fish invasions in catchments throughout California that distinguishes among the establishment, spread and integration stages of the invasion process, and separates social and biological factors related to invasion success. 3. Using Akaike's information criteria (AIC), logistic and multiple regression models, we show suites of biological variables, which are important in predicting establishment (parental care and physiological tolerance), spread (life span, distance from nearest native source and trophic status) and abundance (maximum size, physiological tolerance and distance from nearest native source). Two variables indicating human interest in a species (propagule pressure and prior invasion success) are predictors of successful establishment and prior invasion success is a predictor of spread and integration. 4. Despite the idiosyncratic nature of the invasion process, our results suggest some assistance in the search for characteristics of fish species that successfully transition between invasion stages."

Invertebrate communities were compared on invasive Alternanthera philoxeroides (alligator weed) and native sedges (Isolepis prolifer and Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani) in a New Zealand lake. A. philoxeroides is more architecturally and chemically similar to I. prolifer than to S. tabernaemontani. Lower invertebrate abundance, richness and proportionally fewer specialists were predicted on A. philoxeroides compared to native sedges, but with greatest differences between A. philoxeroides and S. tabernaemontani. A. philoxeroides is more architecturally and chemically similar to I. prolifer than to S. tabernaemontani. Invertebrate abundance showed taxa-specific responses, rather than consistently lower abundance on A. philoxeroides. Nevertheless, as predicted, invertebrate fauna of A. philoxeroides was more similar to that of I. prolifer than to S. tabernaemontani. The prediction of a depauperate native fauna on A. philoxeroides received support from some but not all taxa. All vegetation types hosted generalist-dominated invertebrate communities with simple guild structures. The enemy release hypothesis thus had minimal ability to predict patterns in this system. Results suggest the extent of architectural and chemical differences between native and invasive vegetation may be useful in predicting the extent to which they will host different invertebrate communities. However, invertebrate ecology also affects whether invertebrate taxa respond positively or negatively to weed invasion. Thus, exotic vegetation may support distinct invertebrate communities despite similar overall invertebrate abundance to native vegetation. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS."

In order to identify a suite of traits which characterize invasiveness, recent studies have advocated the use of evolutionary relationships to unravel highly confounded influences. - This study attempts to identify an evolutionary component to invasiveness and other complex invasion-related traits in the Mediterranean alien flora using an autocorrelation technique, the 'phylogenetic association test'. I compared a traditional hierarchical taxonomy with the recent phylogeny of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group. - Invasiveness did not have a significant phylogenetic component. Any weak clustering was generally at the genus level. - Several associated 'meta-traits' (high introduction frequency, adaptation to several habitat types and favourability for different modes of introduction), exhibited stronger phylogenetic components. Although each of these conveys some of the attributes of invasiveness, their clustering patterns differed considerably, suggesting that they arise from independent evolutionary pressures. Furthermore, within each meta-trait, different clusters may have been selected for different reasons. - Other reasons for the lack of a detectable evolutionary component to invasiveness are discussed. Firstly, the results of our test simulations suggested that incorrect phylogeny could result in a moderate degree of error. Secondly, over evolutionary time, complex or stochastic events such as ecosystem change could radically alter the adaptive advantages of particular traits. - Synthesis. Since invasiveness has little phylogenetic component, I argue that it is less likely to be predictable from as yet unidentified traits in any simple way. Although trait syndromes could develop without leaving a phylogenetic pattern, its absence probably indicates that the dominant selective forces are responses to short-term ecological shifts, and a greater mechanistic understanding of these is needed."

We excluded species introduced to just one of the three regions or with significant uncertainty in the historical record, as well as species that succeeded or failed in all regions.

Here, we applied this framework, for the first time, to an animal, the invasive slug, Arion lusitanicus, and tested (i) whether it has a more adaptive phenotypic plasticity compared with a congeneric native slug, Arion fuscus, and (ii) whether it is robust, opportunistic or both. During one year, we exposed specimens of both species to a range of temperatures along an altitudinal gradient (700-2400 m a.s.l.) and to high and low food levels, and we compared the responsiveness of two fitness traits: survival and egg production. During summer, the invasive species had a more adaptive phenotypic plasticity, and at high temperatures and low food levels, it survived better and produced more eggs than A. fuscus, representing the robust phenotype. During winter, A. lusitanicus displayed a less adaptive phenotype than A. fuscus. We show that the framework developed for plants is also very useful for a better mechanistic understanding of animal invasions. Warmer summers and milder winters might lead to an expansion of this invasive species to higher altitudes and enhance its spread in the lowlands, supporting the concern that global climate change will increase biological invasions."

In this study, we address two questions: (1) Do alien species benefit more than native species from human-disturbed habitats? (2) Are alien species more generalized in their habitat use than natives within the invaded range or can their abundance patterns be explained by specialization on the most common habitats? Location Chile. Methods We quantified the use of different habitat types by native and alien coccinellid beetles by sampling individuals in nine habitat types that spanned a gradient in disturbance intensity, and represented the dominant natural, semi-natural and agricultural habitats in the landscape. Results Our results provide strong support for the hypotheses that more-disturbed habitats are differentially invaded. Both the proportion of alien individuals and the proportion of alien species increased significantly with increasing disturbance intensity. In contrast, we found no evidence that alien species were more generalized in their habitat use than native species; in fact, the trend was in the opposite direction. The abundance of specialized alien coccinellid species was not correlated with the area of the habitat types in the landscape. Main conclusion The results suggest that successfully established alien coccinellid species may be disturbance specialists' that thrive within human-modified habitats.

Within the context of the conservation implications, we aimed to quantify (1) the early history and demographics (numbers and origins) of human-mediated brown trout (Salmo trutta) introductions, (2) the current distribution of established populations, and (3) the watershed-scale environmental factors that may resist or facilitate trout establishment. Location Island of Newfoundland, Canada. Methods We combined field sampling with historical and contemporary records from literature to assemble a presence-absence and physical habitat database for 312 watersheds on Newfoundland. Probability of watershed establishment was modelled with general additive ANCOVA models to control for nonlinear effects of propagule pressure (i.e. the distance to and number of invasion foci within a biologically relevant range) and model performance based on AIC. Results Between 1883 and 1906, 16 watersheds were introduced with brown trout from the Howietoun Hatchery, near Stirling, Scotland. Since that time, populations have established in 51 additional watersheds at an estimated rate of spread of 4 km per year. We did not detect any obvious abiotic barriers to resist trout establishment, but showed that for a given amount of propagule pressure that relatively large and productive watersheds were most likely to be established. Main conclusions Brown trout have successfully invaded and established populations in watersheds of Newfoundland and are currently slowly expanding on the island. Populations are more likely to establish in relatively large and productive watersheds, thereby supporting predictions of island biogeography theory.

Our results do not support several fundamental predictions of invasion biology. Established exotics (79 of 147 recorded plant species) were nearly indistinguishable from the native plant species (i.e. in terms of growth form, taxonomic grouping, and patterns of spatial distribution and abundance) and essentially represent a random sub-set of the current regional species pool. The cover and richness of exotic species varied substantially among quadrats and sites but were not strongly related to any site-level physical characteristics thought to affect invasibility (i.e. the physical disturbance regime, legal status, neighboring habitat type, and substrate characteristics). Native and exotic cover or richness were not negatively related within most sites. Across sites, native and exotic richness were positively correlated and exotic cover was unrelated to native richness. The colonization and spread of exotics does not appear to have been substantially reduced at sites with high native diversity. Furthermore, despite the fact that the Rhode Island strandline system is one of the most highly-invaded natural plant communities described to date, exotic species, both individually and as a group, currently appear to pose little threat to native plant diversity. Our findings are concordant with most recent, large-scale investigations that do not support the theoretical foundation of invasion biology and generally contradict small-scale experimental work."

Morphological and physiological responses to different light fluxes were analyzed. L. camara was able to acclimate to moderately shaded environments, showing a high phenotypic plasticity. Morphological acclimation to low light fluxes was typified by increasing leaf size, leaf biomass, leaf area index and plant height and by reduced stomatal density and leaf thickness. Plants in full sunlight produced many more inflorescences than in shaded conditions. Physiological acclimation to low radiation levels was shown to be higher stomatal conductance, higher net photosynthetic rates and higher efficiency of photosystem II (PSII). L. camara behaves as a facultative shade-tolerant plant, being able to grow in moderately sheltered environments, however its invasion could be limited in very shady habitats. Control efforts in patchy environments should be mainly directed against individuals in open areas since that is where the production of seeds would be higher and the progress of the invasion would be faster."

Often, both herbivore identity and plant community type modulate this effect. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of grazing on non-native plant species richness and cover in montane grasslands of central Argentina as related to herbivore identity (horse or cattle) and plant community type. The study was conducted in piedmont valleys of the Ventania Mountains. The area is occupied by two major types of plant communities: short-needlegrass and tall-tussock grasslands. Short-needlegrass grasslands occupy poor soils and have higher plant species diversity compared to tall-tussock grasslands which typically grow on rich soils. Part of the study area is devoted to cattle husbandry, part is inhabited by feral horses, and part has been free of grazing by large herbivores for the last 15 years. We compared non-native species richness and cover at three levels of grazing (horse grazing, cattle grazing, grazing exclusion) and two levels of plant community type (short-needlegrass grassland and tall-tussock grassland) at the end of the growing season in 2006 and 2007. Thirty-one non-native plant species were found growing in the study area. Grazing increased non-native species richness and cover and was highest under horse grazing and in communities on resource-rich soils. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that grazing by large non-native herbivores can facilitate non-native plant species invasion of natural grasslands. They also suggest that herbivore identity and community type modulate the effect of large herbivore grazing on grassland invasion by non-native plant species."

Samples were taken at 10 km intervals along 750 km of selected roads that provided a climatic gradient from semi-arid to hyperoceanic conditions and which crossed both, areas of farmland, where the native vegetation has been replaced by an anthropogenic plant cover consisting almost entirely of introduced species, and areas of managed native tussock grassland and native forest. Contiguous plots, placed in four zones parallel to the road, were used to examine any lateral differentiation of vegetation. Variation in floristic composition in all four zones was associated with variation in rainfall, continentality, altitude, and the presence of forest. In all sites there was a distinct change in species composition from the outer verge to the inner roadside. The vegetation of the zone nearest to the road showed weaker correlation with altitude and stronger correlation with continentality, a marked increase in short-lived exotic species, and a greater proportion of the more continental and weedy vegetation types than the vegetation of the outermost verge. This supports the hypothesis of anthropogenic continentality of road-shoulders. The most frequent species on the road-shoulders are those exotic species that transgress climatic barriers in their native continents. This suggests that, globally, the range of such species is liable to expand, particularly in the habitat-complex provided by roadsides."

However, contrasting with this central role of phenotypic plasticity, standard models aimed to predict the effect of climatic change on species distributions do not allow for the inclusion of differences in plastic responses among populations. In this context, the climatic variability hypothesis (CVH), which states that higher thermal variability at higher latitudes should determine an increase in phenotypic plasticity with latitude, could be considered a timely and promising hypothesis. Accordingly, in this study we evaluated, for the first time in a plant species (Taraxacum officinale), the prediction of the CVH. Specifically, we measured plastic responses at different environmental temperatures (5 and 20 degrees C), in several ecophysiological and fitness-related traits for five populations distributed along a broad latitudinal gradient. Overall, phenotypic plasticity increased with latitude for all six traits analyzed, and mean trait values increased with latitude at both experimental temperatures, the change was noticeably greater at 20 degrees than at 5 degrees C. Our results suggest that the positive relationship found between phenotypic plasticity and geographic latitude could have very deep implications on future species persistence and invasion processes under a scenario of climate change."

The physiological and morphological responses of B. javanica to both simulated canopy opening and closure were compared against three native species of different successional status: Trema orientalis Blume (pioneer), Schima mertensiana (Sieb. et Zucc.) Koidz (mid-successional) and Elaeocarpus photiniaefolius Hook.et Arn (late-successional). The results revealed significant species-specific differences in the timing of physiological maturity and phenotypic plasticity in leaves developed under constant high and low light levels. For example, the photosynthetic capacity of T. orientalis reached a maximum in leaves that had just fully expanded when grown under constant high light (50% of full sun) whereas that of E . photiniaefolius leaves continued to increase until 50 d after full expansion. For leaves that had just reached full expansion, T. orientalis , having high photosynthetic plasticity between high and low light, exhibited low acclimation capacity under the changing light (from high to low or low to high light). In comparison with native species, B. javanica showed a higher degree of physiological and morphological acclimation following transfer to a new light condition in leaves of all age classes (i.e. before and after reaching full expansion). The high acclimation ability of B. javanica in response to changes in light availability may be a part of its pre-adaptations for invasiveness in the fluctuating environment of the Bonin Islands."

A native relict population of R. ponticum was sampled in southern Spain (Mediterranean climate), while an invasive alien population was investigated in Belgium (temperate maritime climate). Ilex aquifolium was native at both sites. Both species exhibited a significant plastic response to Q(int) in leaf dry mass per unit area, thickness, photosynthetic potentials, and chlorophyll contents at the two sites. However, R. ponticum exhibited a higher photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency and larger investment of nitrogen in chlorophyll than I. aquifolium . Since leaf nitrogen (N) contents per unit dry mass were lower in R. ponticum , this species formed a larger foliar area with equal photosynthetic potential and light-harvesting efficiency compared with I. aquifolium . The foliage of R. ponticum was mechanically more resistant with larger density in the Belgian site than in the Spanish site. Mean leaf-level phenotypic plasticity was larger in the Belgian population of R. ponticum than in the Spanish population of this species and the two populations of I. aquifolium. We suggest that large fractional investments of foliar N in photosynthetic function coupled with a relatively large mean, leaf-level phenotypic plasticity may provide the primary explanation for the invasive nature and superior performance of R. ponticum at the Belgian site. With alleviation of water limitations from Mediterranean to temperate maritime climates, the invasiveness of R. ponticum may also be enhanced by the increased foliage mechanical resistance observed in the alien populations."

Many introduced species fail to interact strongly with the recipient biota, whereas others profoundly disrupt the ecosystems they invade through predation, competition, and other mechanisms. In the context of ecological impacts, research on biological invasions seldom considers phenotypic or microevolutionary changes that occur following introduction. Here, we show how plasticity in key life history traits ( colony size and longevity), together with omnivory, magnifies the predatory impacts of an invasive social wasp ( Vespula pensylvanica) on a largely endemic arthropod fauna in Hawaii. Using a combination of molecular, experimental, and behavioral approaches, we demonstrate (i) that yellowjackets consume an astonishing diversity of arthropod resources and depress prey populations in invaded Hawaiian ecosystems and (ii) that their impact as predators in this region increases when they shift from small annual colonies to large perennial colonies. Such trait plasticity may influence invasion success and the degree of disruption that invaded ecosystems experience. Moreover, postintroduction phenotypic changes may help invaders to compensate for reductions in adaptive potential resulting from founder events and small population sizes. The dynamic nature of biological invasions necessitates a more quantitative understanding of how postintroduction changes in invader traits affect invasion processes."

Using general linear models, we established which characteristics are most important for success at each invasion stage. Prior invasion success was a good predictor for all the stages of the invasion process. Biological variables relevant for more than one invasion stage were maximum adult size and size of native range. Despite these common variables, all models produced a different set of variables important for a successful invasion, demonstrating that successful invaders have a combination of biological traits that may favor success at all invasion stages.

We tested the hypothesis that seedlings from within the invasive U.S. range of M. sinensis would display traits associated with shade tolerance, namely increased area for light capture and phenotypic plasticity, compared with seedlings from the native Japanese populations. In a common garden experiment, seedlings of 80 half-sib maternal lines were grown from the native range (Japan) and 60 half-sib maternal lines from the invasive range (U.S.) under four light levels. Seedling leaf area, leaf size, growth, and biomass allocation were measured on the resulting seedlings after 12 wk. Seedlings from both regions responded strongly to the light gradient. High light conditions resulted in seedlings with greater leaf area, larger leaves, and a shift to greater belowground biomass investment, compared with shaded seedlings. Japanese seedlings produced more biomass and total leaf area than U.S. seedlings across all light levels. Generally, U.S. and Japanese seedlings allocated a similar amount of biomass to foliage and equal leaf area per leaf mass. Subtle differences in light response by region were observed for total leaf area, mass, growth, and leaf size. U.S. seedlings had slightly higher plasticity for total mass and leaf area but lower plasticity for measures of biomass allocation and leaf traits compared with Japanese seedlings.

Four herbivores co-occurred with C. taxifolia and their densities were often low or zero at the sites studied.

Across larger spatial scales, positive relationships suggest that exotic and native species respond similarly to factors other than diversity. In the case of island habitats, such factors may include island size and isolation from the mainland. However, previous island studies exploring this issue examined only a few islands or islands separated by extreme distances. In this study, we surveyed exotic and native plant diversity on 25 islands separated by <15 km in Boston Harbor. Exotic and native species richness were positively correlated. Consistent with island biogeography theory, species richness of both groups was positively related to area and negatively related to isolation. However, the isolation effect was significantly stronger for native species. This differential effect of isolation on native species translated into exotic species representing a higher proportion of all plant species on more distant islands. The community similarity of inner harbor islands vs. outer harbor islands was greater for exotic species, indicating that isolation had a weaker influence on individual exotic species. These results contrast with recent work focusing on similarities between exotic and native species and highlight the importance of studies that use an island biogeographic approach to better understand those factors influencing the ecology of invasive species."

The relative importance of resource partitioning for invasion resistance, however, may depend on how species abundance is distributed in the plant community. This study had two objectives. First, we quantified the degree to which one resource, nitrogen (N), is partitioned by time, depth and chemical form among coexisting species from different functional groups by injecting N-15 into soils around the study species three times during the growing season, at two soil depths and as two chemical forms. A watering treatment also was applied to evaluate the impact of soil water content on N partitioning. Second, we examined the degree to which native functional groups contributed to invasion resistance by seeding a non-native annual grass into plots where bunchgrasses, perennial forbs or annual forbs had been removed. Bunchgrasses and forbs differed in timing, depth and chemical form of N capture, and these patterns of N partitioning were not affected by soil water content. However, when we incorporated abundance (biomass) with these relative measures of N capture to determine N sequestration by the community there was no evidence suggesting that functional groups partitioned different soil N pools. Instead, dominant bunchgrasses acquired the most N from all soil N pools. Consistent with these findings we also found that bunchgrasses were the only functional group that inhibited annual grass establishment. At natural levels of species abundance, N partitioning may facilitate coexistence but may not necessarily contribute to N sequestration and invasion resistance by the plant community. This suggests that a general mechanism of invasion resistance may not be expected across systems. Instead, the key mechanism of invasion resistance within a system may depend on trait variation among coexisting species and on how species abundance is distributed in the system."

We used wild boar (Sus scrofa) as a model species to evaluate the role of non-native mammals in promoting plant invasion by identifying the degree to which soil disturbance and endozoochorous seed dispersal drive plant invasions. To test if soil disturbance promotes plant invasion, we conducted an exclosure experiment in which we recorded emergence, establishment and biomass of seedlings of seven non-native plant species planted in no-rooting, boar-rooting and artificial rooting patches in Patagonia, Argentina. To examine the role of boar in dispersing seeds we germinated viable seeds from 181 boar droppings and compared this collection to the soil seed bank by collecting a soil sample adjacent to each dropping. We found that both establishment and biomass of non-native seedlings in boar-rooting patches were double those in no-rooting patches. Values in artificial rooting patches were intermediate between those in boar-rooting and no-rooting treatments. By contrast, we found that the proportion of non-native seedlings in the soil samples was double that in the droppings, and over 80% of the germinated seeds were native species in both samples. Lastly, an effect size test showed that soil disturbance by wild boar rather than endozoochorous dispersal facilitates plant invasions. These results have implications for both the native and introduced ranges of wild boar, where rooting disturbance may facilitate community composition shifts."

Of the 139 bryophytes species which are alien in the study regions seven cause negative impacts on biodiversity in 26 regions, whereas three species cause negative impacts on socio-economic sectors in five regions. The vast majority of impacts stem from anecdotal observations, whereas only 14 field or experimental studies (mostly on Campylopus introflexus in Europe) have quantitatively assessed the impacts of an alien bryophyte. The main documented type of impact on biodiversity is competition (8 alien bryophytes), with native cryptogams being most affected. In particular, C. introflexus (9 regions) and Pseudoscleropodium purum (7 regions) affect resident species composition. The few socio-economic impacts are caused by alien bryophytes which form dense mats in lawns and are then considered a nuisance. Most negative impacts on biodiversity have been recorded in natural grasslands, forests, and wetlands. Impacts of alien bryophytes on biodiversity and socio-economy are a recent phenomenon, with > 85 % of impacts on biodiversity, and 80 % of impacts on socio-economy recorded since 1990. On average, 40 years (impacts on biodiversity) and 25 years (impacts on socio-economy) elapsed between the year a bryophyte species has been first recorded as alien in a region and the year impacts have been recorded first. Taking into account the substantial time lag between first record and first recorded impact in a region, it seems to be likely that the currently moderate impacts of alien bryophytes will continue to increase. As quantitative studies on impacts of alien bryophytes are rare and restricted to few environments and biogeographic regions, there is a need for addressing potential impacts of alien bryophytes in yet understudied settings."

I examined their importance in controlling the number of native and exotic plant species occupying tussocks formed by the sedge Carex nudata along a California stream. Of particular interest were the factors underlying a downstream increase in plant diversity and biological invasions. I conducted seed addition experiments and manipulated local diversity and cover to evaluate the degree to which tussocks saturate with species, and to examine the roles of local competitive processes, abiotic factors, and seed supply in controlling the system-wide patterns. Seeds of three native and three exotic plants sown onto experimentally assembled tussock communities less successfully established on tussocks with a greater richness of resident plants. Nonetheless, even the most diverse tussocks were somewhat colonized, suggesting that tussocks are not completely saturated with species. Similarly, in an experiment where I sowed seeds onto natural tussocks along the river, colonization increased two- to three-fold when I removed the resident species. Even on intact tussocks, however, seed addition increased diversity, indicating that the tussock assemblages are seed limited. Colonization success on cleared and uncleared tussocks increased downstream from km 0 to km 3 of the study site, but showed no trends from km 3 to km 8. This suggests that while abiotic and biotic features of the tussocks may control the increase in diversity and invasions from km 0 to km 3, similar increases from km 3 to km 8 are more likely explained by potential downstream increases in seed supply. The effective water dispersal of seed mimics and prevailingly downstream winds indicated that dispersal most likely occurs in a downstream direction. These results suggest that resident species diversity, competitive interactions, and seed supply similarly influence the colonization of native and exotic species."

We recensused transects in invaded unburned woodland and woodland that had burned in exotic grass-fueled fires in 1970 and 1987 and had last been censused in 1991. In the unburned woodlands, we found that the dominant understory grass invader, Schizachyrium condensatum, had declined by 40%, while native understory species were abundant and largely unchanged from measurements 17 years ago. In burned woodland, exotic grass cover also declined, but overall values remained high and recruitment of native species was poor.

Grass-dominated sites that had burned twice also showed limited recovery despite 20 years of fire suppression. We found limited evidence for ""invasional meltdown"": Exotic richness remained low across burned sites, and the dominant species in 1991, Melinis minutiflora, is still dominant today. Twice-burned sites are, however, being invaded by the nitrogen-fixing tree Morella faya, an introduced species with the potential to greatly alter the successional trajectory on young volcanic soils. In summary, despite decades of fire suppression, native species show little recovery in burned Hawaiian woodlands. Thus, burned sites appear to be beyond a threshold for ""natural recovery"" (e.g., passive restoration)."

We recreated a naturally occurring gradient in species richness to test the effects of species richness on community invasibility. In central Texas savannas, as the proportion of woody plants increases (a process known as woody plant encroachment), herbaceous habitat is both lost and fragmented, and native herbaceous species richness declines. We examined the effects of these species losses on invasibility in situ by removing species that occur less frequently in herbaceous patches as woody plant encroachment advances. This realistic species removal was accompanied by a parallel and equivalent removal of biomass with no changes in species richness. Over two springs, the nonnative bunchgrass Bothriochloa ischaemum germinated significantly more often in the biomass-removal treatment than in unmanipulated control plots, suggesting an effect of native plant density independent of diversity. Additionally, significantly more germination occurred in the species-removal treatment than in the biomass-removal treatment. Changes in species richness had a stronger effect on B. ischaemum germination than changes in plant density, demonstrating that niche-related processes contributed more to biotic resistance in this system than did species-neutral competitive interactions. Similar treatment effects were found on transplant growth. Thus we show that woody plant encroachment indirectly facilitates the establishment of an invasive grass by reducing native diversity. Although we found a negative relationship between species richness and invasibility at the scale of plots with similar composition and environmental conditions, we found a positive relationship between species richness and invasibility at larger scales. This apparent paradox is consistent with reports from other systems and may be the result of variation in environmental factors at larger scales similarly influencing both invasibility and richness. The habitat loss and fragmentation associated with woody plant encroachment are two of many processes that commonly threaten biodiversity, including climate change. Many of these processes are similarly likely to increase invasibility via their negative effects on native diversity."

Generalized linear mixed models were fitted by Laplace approximation considering a binomial error distribution and logit link function. Location and species were considered as random effects and species categorization (native or non-indigenous) as fixed effects. We found that native birds from Brazil presented significantly higher parasite prevalence in accordance with the ERH. We also compared our data with the literature, and found that house sparrows native to Europe exhibited significantly higher parasite prevalence than introduced house sparrows from Brazil, which also supports the ERH. Therefore, it is possible that house sparrows from Brazil might have experienced a parasitic release during the process of introduction, which might also be related to a demographic release (e.g. release from the negative effects of parasites on host population dynamics)."

Here, we used data on naturalized conifers (Pinaceae, Cupressaceae) from sixty temperate and subtropical regions and five continents to test how environmental and socio-economic conditions of recipient areas as well as introduction efforts affect naturalization probabilities. We collated 18 predictor variables for each region describing environmental, biogeographic and socio-economic conditions as well as a measure of the macro-climatic match with the species' native ranges, and the extent to which alien conifers are used in commercial forestry. Naturalization probabilities across all species and regions were then related to these predictor variables by means of generalized linear mixed models. For both Pinaceae and Cupressaceae, naturalization probabilities were generally higher in the Southern Hemisphere, and increased with indicators of habitat diversity of the recipient region. The match in macro-climatic conditions between the native and introduced regions was a significant predictor of conifer naturalization, but socio-economic variables were less powerful predictors. Only for Cupressaceae did a socio-economic variable (human population density) affect naturalization probabilities. Key attributes facilitating naturalization were related to introduction effort. Moreover, usage in commercial forestry generally fostered naturalization, although the actual size of alien conifer plantations in a region was only correlated with the naturalization of Pinaceae. Our results suggest that climate matching, habitat diversity and introduction effort co-determine the probability of naturalization, which additionally, is modulated by biogeographic features of the recipient area, such as incidence of natural enemies or competitors. To date, the most widely used tools for invasive plant risk assessment only account for climate match and rarely factor in other attributes of the recipient environment. Future tools should additionally consider biotic environment and introduction effort if risk assessment is to be effective."

At Konza Prairie Biological Station, we sampled soil macroinvertebrates in 1994 and 1999 as part of a long-term experiment designed to examine the effects and interactions of annual fire, mowing, and fertilization (N and P) on prairie soil communities and processes. For nearly all taxa, in both years, responses were characterized by significant treatment interactions, but some general patterns were evident. Introduced European earthworms (Aporrectodea spp. and Octolasion spp.) were most abundant in plots where fire was excluded, and the proportion of the total earthworm community consisting of introduced earthworms was greater in unburned, unmowed, and fertilized plots. Nymphs of two Cicada genera were collected (Cicadetta spp. and Tibicen spp.). Cicadetta nymphs were more abundant in burned plots, but mowing reduced their abundance.

Moreover, closely related competing native hosts can be affected by acquiring introduced taxa (spillover) and by increased transmission risk of native parasites (spillback). We determined the macroparasite fauna of invasive grey squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) in Italy to detect any diversity loss, introduction of novel parasites or acquisition of local ones, and analysed variation in parasite burdens to identify factors that may increase transmission risk for native red squirrels (S. vulgaris). Based on 277 grey squirrels sampled from 7 populations characterised by different time scales in introduction events, we identified 7 gastro-intestinal helminths and 4 parasite arthropods. Parasite richness is lower than in grey squirrel's native range and independent from introduction time lags. The most common parasites are Nearctic nematodes Strongyloides robustus (prevalence: 56.6%) and Trichostrongylus calcaratus (6.5%), red squirrel flea Ceratophyllus sciurorum (26.0%) and Holarctic sucking louse Neohaematopinus sciuri (17.7%). All other parasites are European or cosmopolitan species with prevalence below 5%. S. robustus abundance is positively affected by host density and body mass, C. sciurorum abundance increases with host density and varies with seasons. Overall, we show that grey squirrels in Italy may benefit of an enemy release, and both spillback and spillover processes towards native red squirrels may occur."

The species recovered coincident with the intense fishing of Nile perch in the 1990s, when water clarity and dissolved oxygen levels had decreased dramatically due to increased eutrophication. In response to the hypoxic conditions, total gill surface in resurgent H. pyrrhocephalus increased by 64%. Remarkably, head length, eye length, and head volume decreased in size, whereas cheek depth increased. Reductions in eye size and depth of the rostral part of the musculus sternohyoideus, and reallocation of space between the opercular and suspensorial compartments of the head may have permitted accommodation of larger gills in a smaller head. By contrast, the musculus levator posterior, located dorsal to the gills, increased in depth. This probably reflects an adaptive response to the larger and tougher prey types in the diet of resurgent H. pyrrhocephalus. These striking morphological changes over a time span of only two decades could be the combined result of phenotypic plasticity and genetic change and may have fostered recovery of this species.

We tested this general hypothesis by examining the distribution of small mammals along gradients of anthropogenic habitat disturbance in northern Luzon Island, an area with a very high level of mammalian endemism. Location Central Cordillera, northern Luzon Island, Philippines. Methods Using standard trapping techniques, we documented the occurrence and abundance of 16 endemic and two non-native species along four disturbance gradients where habitat ranged from mature forest to deforested cropland. Using regression analysis and AIC(c) for model selection, we assessed the influence of four predictor variables (geographic range, elevational range, body size and diet breadth) on the disturbance tolerance of species. Results Non-native species dominated areas with the most severe disturbance and were rare or absent in mature forest. Native species richness declined with increasing disturbance level, but responses of individual species varied. Elevational range (a measure of habitat breadth) was the best predictor of response of native species to habitat disturbance. Geographic range, body size and diet breadth were weakly correlated. Main conclusions The endemic small mammal fauna of northern Luzon includes species adapted to varying levels of natural disturbance and appears to be resistant to disruption by resident alien species. In these respects, it resembles a diverse continental fauna rather than a depauperate insular fauna. We conclude that the long and complex history of Luzon as an ancient member of the Philippine island arc system has involved highly dynamic ecological conditions resulting in a biota adapted to changing conditions. We predict that similar responses will be seen in other taxonomic groups and in other ancient island arc systems."

We analyzed a unique set of data derived from the detailed sales catalogs (1887-1930) of the most important early Florida, USA, plant nursery (Royal Palm Nursery) to detect naturalization patterns of these horticultural plants in the state. Of the 1903 nonnative species sold by the nursery, 15% naturalized. The probability of plants becoming naturalized increases significantly with the number of years the plants were marketed. Plants that became invasive and naturalized were sold for an average of 19.6 and 14.8 years, respectively, compared to 6.8 years for non-naturalized plants, and the naturalization of plants sold for 30 years or more is 70%. Unexpectedly, plants that were sold earlier were less likely to naturalize than those sold later. The nursery's inexperience, which caused them to grow and market many plants unsuited to Florida during their early period, may account for this pattern. Plants with pantropical distributions and those native to both Africa and Asia were more likely to naturalize (42%), than were plants native to other smaller regions, suggesting that plants with large native ranges were more likely to naturalize. Naturalization percentages also differed according to plant life form, with the most naturalization occurring in aquatic herbs (36.8%) and vines (30.8%). Plants belonging to the families Araceae, Apocynaceae, Convolvulaceae, Moraceae, Oleaceae, and Verbenaceae had higher than expected naturalization. Information theoretic model selection indicated that the number of years a plant was sold, alone or together with the first year a plant was sold, was the strongest predictor of naturalization. Because continued importation and marketing of nonnative horticultural plants will lead to additional plant naturalization and invasion, a comprehensive approach to address this problem, including research to identify and select noninvasive forms and types of horticultural plants is urgently needed."

The aim of this study was to understand the mechanisms through which functional group composition can influence the resistance of Mediterranean annual communities to invasion by the exotic Conyza bonariensis. To analyse the effects of functional composition on the performance of individuals introduced as seedlings we first examined the relationships between the demographic and vegetative parameters of C. bonariensis and the biomass achieved by each functional group (grasses, legumes and Asteraceae rosettes) in synthetic communities. As a further step to approach the mechanisms involved in community resistance to invasion, we included in the analyses measurements of functional variables taken within the synthetic communities. In agreement with earlier results and theory suggesting that high nutrient availability can favour invasions, an abundant legume biomass in communities increased the final biomass and net fecundity of C. bonariensis, due to positive effects on soil nitrate concentration. Survival and establishment of C. bonariensis were mainly favoured by a high biomass of Asteraceae. Additional results from measurements of herbivory suggested that C. bonariensis survival wasn't related to abiotic conditions but may be owed to a protection against herbivores in plots with abundant Asteraceae. Establishment was on the other hand likely to be hindered by the effects of abundant grass and legume foliage on light quality, and therefore easier within an Asteraceae canopy. We conclude that invasion of Mediterranean old fields by species with biologies similar to C. bonariensis could be limited by favouring communities dominated by annual grasses."

Others have hypothesized that invaders may introduce exotic parasites to native species and/or may become hosts to native parasites in their new habitats. Our study analyzed the parasites of two exotic Eurasian gobies that were detected in the Great Lakes in 1990: the round goby Apollonia melanostoma and the tubenose goby Proterorhinus semilunaris. We compared our results from the central region of their introduced ranges in Lakes Huron, St. Clair, and Erie with other studies in the Great Lakes over the past decade, as well as Eurasian native and nonindigenous habitats. Results showed that goby-specific metazoan parasites were absent in the Great Lakes, and all but one species were represented only as larvae, suggesting that adult parasites presently are poorly-adapted to the new gobies as hosts. Seven parasitic species are known to infest the tubenose goby in the Great Lakes, including our new finding of the acanthocephalan Southwellina hispida, and all are rare. We provide the first findings of four parasite species in the round goby and clarified two others, totaling 22 in the Great Lakes-with most being rare. In contrast, 72 round goby parasites occur in the Black Sea region. Trematodes are the most common parasitic group of the round goby in the Great Lakes, as in their native Black Sea range and Baltic Sea introduction. Holarctic trematode Diplostomum spathaceum larvae, which are one of two widely distributed species shared with Eurasia, were found in round goby eyes from all Great Lakes localities except Lake Huron proper. Our study and others reveal no overall increases in parasitism of the invasive gobies over the past decade after their establishment in the Great Lakes. In conclusion, the parasite ""load"" on the invasive gobies appears relatively low in comparison with their native habitats, lending support to the ""enemy release hypothesis."""

J.Torrey Bot. Soc. 137: 380-390. 2010.-We documented microhabitat occurrence and growth of Lonicera japonica to identify factors related to its invasion into a southern Illinois shale barren. The barren was surveyed for L. japonica in June 2003, and the microhabitats of established L. japonica plants were compared to random points that sampled the range of available microhabitats in the barren. Vine and leaf characters were used as measurements of plant growth. Lonicera japonica occurred preferentially in areas of high litter cover and species richness, comparatively small trees, low PAR, low soil moisture and temperature, steep slopes, and shallow soils. Plant growth varied among these microhabitats. Among plots where L. japonica occurred, growth was related to soil and light conditions, and aspects of surrounding cover. Overhead canopy cover was a common variable associated with nearly all measured growth traits. Plasticity of traits to improve invader success can only affect the likelihood of invasion once constraints to establishment and persistence have been surmounted. Therefore, understanding where L. japonica invasion occurs, and microhabitat interactions with plant growth are important for estimating invasion success."

Our ability to quantitatively predict these impacts is, in part, limited by the absence of suitable plant-spread models and by inadequate parameter estimates for such models. This paper explores the effects of model, plant, and environmental attributes on predicted rates and patterns of spread of alien pine trees (Pinus spp.) in South African fynbos (a mediterranean-type shrubland). A factorial experimental design was used to: (1) compare the predictions of a simple reaction-diffusion model and a spatially explicit, individual-based simulation model; (2) investigate the sensitivity of predicted rates and patterns of spread to parameter values; and (3) quantify the effects of the simulation model's spatial grain on its predictions. The results show that the spatial simulation model places greater emphasis on interactions among ecological processes than does the reaction-diffusion model. This ensures that the predictions of the two models differ substantially for some factor combinations. The most important factor in the model is dispersal ability. Fire frequency, fecundity, and age of reproductive maturity are less important, while adult mortality has little effect on the model's predictions. The simulation model's predictions are sensitive to the model's spatial grain. This suggests that simulation models that use matrices as a spatial framework should ensure that the spatial grain of the model is compatible with the spatial processes being modeled. We conclude that parameter estimation and model development must be integrated procedures. This will ensure that the model's structure is compatible with the biological processes being modeled.

In addition, the Korba hill lake population seemed to have more important values of total length, eye diameter, maximum body height and a higher distance between mouth and operculum than the other populations. However, the most accentuated segregation was found in the Lebna sample where the individuals were characterized by high snout length, body thickness, pectoral fin length, maximum body height and distance between mouth and operculum. This study shows the existence of morphological differentiations between populations derived from a single gene pool that have been isolated in separated sites for several decades although in relatively similar environments."

The species has been introduced into these systems, expanding its range, and is presumably well adapted to freshwater Iberian Peninsula ecosystems. The results show a consistent pattern for size of lateral fins, with L. gibbosus that inhabit streams in the Iberian Peninsula having longer lateral fins than those inhabiting reservoirs or lakes. Differences in fin placement, body depth and caudal peduncle dimensions do not differentiate populations of L. gibbosus from lentic and lotic water bodies and, therefore, are not consistent with functional expectations. Lepomis gibbosus from lotic and lentic habitats also do not show a consistent pattern of internal morphological differentiation, probably due to the lack of loticlentic differences in prey type. Overall, the univariate and multivariate analyses show that most of the external and internal morphological characters that vary among populations do not differentiate lotic from lentic Iberian populations. The lack of expected differences may be a consequence of the high seasonal flow variation in Mediterranean streams, and the resultant low- or no-flow conditions during periods of summer drought.

The spatial and temporal variation of body weight (BW), body length (BL), tail length, hind-foot length and ear length were analysed. Temporal trends in BW and BL in relation to years since mink introduction were also analyzed. In addition, we tested the effect of sex, age (juvenile, subadult and adult) and age-sex interaction, on each parameter. Morphological parameters differed between populations, illustrating the high variability of body size of American mink in different environments, and the phenotypic plasticity of the species. Annual variations were synchronized between populations, suggesting a large-scale effect on all of them. BW and BL showed a decreasing trend in both males and females in relation to years since introduction. This decrease may be related to mink's diet. Differences in sex and age were found, pointing to sexual dimorphism in adults, subadults and juveniles. The dimorphism in non-adult individuals suggests that subadult males may have a competitive advantage from subadult females in feeding and/or hunting on bigger prey from an early age (resource partitioning hypothesis).

The percentage of eggs attacked by natural enemies did not differ between sites, which does not support the enemy release hypothesis for this life stage.

In addition, the first known egg parasitoid of A. auroguttatus was collected during this study from a single egg deployed in AZ, and was identified as Trichogramma sp. using molecular techniques. This parasitoid is a generalist, and therefore not suitable for use in a classical biological control program against A. auroguttatus in CA.

Movement, and particularly the colonisation of new habitat patches, remains one of the least known aspects of the life history and ecology of the vast majority of species. Here, a series of experiments was conducted to rectify this problem with Delphacodes scolochloa Cronin & Wilson, a wing-dimorphic planthopper of the North American Great Plains. 2. The movement of brachypterous and macropterous planthoppers within and among host-plant patches was quantified. Also, an experiment was conducted to assess whether planthopper propagule size (i.e. number of colonists) influenced the presence of planthopper adults or eggs over time, planthopper population growth rate (R-0), and abundance or impact of an egg parasitoid. 3. Delphacodes scolochloa movement was well described by a simple diffusion model. As expected, brachypters were less dispersive than macropters - mean displacement distances among patches were three times greater for macropters (2.8 m vs. 8.1 m per day). 4. Number of colonists of vacant patches increased with increasing patch size (both wing forms) and decreased with increasing isolation (brachypters only). At the scale of individual potholes (< 38 m), brachypters were dispersal limited. 5. Establishment success was strongly influenced by propagule size. An Allee effect constrained the establishment of new populations, but low establishment success was not a result of mate limitations or the presence of natural enemies (i.e. egg parasitoids).6. These movement data reveal important insights regarding the spatial population structure and spread of D. scolochloa."

Methods dWe combined a common garden experiment, replicated in three climatically different central European regions, with reciprocal transplantation to quantify genetic differentiation in growth and reproductive traits of 20 invasive B. davidii populations. Additionally, we compared compensatory regrowth among populations after clipping of stems to simulate mechanical damage. Important Findings Our results do not provide evidence for clinal variation among invasive B. davidii populations: populations responded similarly to the different environments, and trait values were not correlated to climatic conditions or geographic coordinates of their home sites. Moreover, we did not detect differences in the compensatory ability of populations. We suppose that the invasive spread of B. davidii has been facilitated by phenotypic plasticity rather than by adaptation to climate and that continent-wide shuffling of cultivars due to horticultural trade may have limited local adaptation so far."

Sequential invasions by predators can enhance risk for native prey. Prey have a limited ability to respond to multiple threats since appropriate responses may conflict, and interactions with recent invaders may be novel. We examined predatorprey interactions among two non-native predators, a recent invader, the African jewelfish, and the longer-established Mayan cichlid, and a native Florida Everglades prey assemblage. Using field enclosures and laboratory aquaria, we compared predatory effects and antipredator responses across five prey taxa. Total predation rates were higher for Mayan cichlids, which also targeted more prey types. The cichlid invaders had similar microhabitat use, but varied in foraging styles, with African jewelfish being more active. The three prey species that experienced predation were those that overlapped in habitat use with predators. Flagfish were consumed by both predators, while riverine grass shrimp and bluefin killifish were eaten only by Mayan cichlids. In mixed predator treatments, we saw no evidence of emergent effects, since interactions between the two cichlid predators were low. Prey responded to predator threats by altering activity but not vertical distribution. Results suggest that prey vulnerability is affected by activity and habitat domain overlap with predators and may be lower to newly invading predators, perhaps due to novelty in the interaction."

Plastic responses to spatiotemporal environmental variation strongly influence species distribution, with widespread species expected to have high phenotypic plasticity. Theoretically, high phenotypic plasticity has been linked to plant invasiveness because it facilitates colonization and rapid spreading over large and environmentally heterogeneous new areas. 2. To determine the importance of phenotypic plasticity for plant invasiveness, we compare well-known exotic invasive species with widespread native congeners. First, we characterized the phenotype of 20 invasive-native ecologically and phylogenetically related pairs from the Mediterranean region by measuring 20 different traits involved in resource acquisition, plant competition ability and stress tolerance. Second, we estimated their plasticity across nutrient and light gradients. 3. On average, invasive species had greater capacity for carbon gain and enhanced performance over a range of limiting to saturating resource availabilities than natives. However, both groups responded to environmental variations with high albeit similar levels of trait plasticity. Therefore, contrary to the theory, the extent of phenotypic plasticity was not significantly higher for invasive plants. 4. We argue that the combination of studying mean values of a trait with its plasticity can render insightful conclusions on functional comparisons of species such as those exploring the performance of species coexisting in heterogeneous and changing environments."

Sculpins in combination with Sacramento pikeminnow caused greater mortality of speckled dace than predicted based on their separate effects.

For patterns of introduced salmonid richness and dominance, we also examine the biotic resistance and human activity hypotheses. We were particularly interested in identifying the factors that best explain the persistence of salmonid-free lakes in Patagonia. Location Chile (39 degrees to 54 degrees S). Methods We conducted an extensive survey of 63 lakes, over a broad latitudinal range. We tested for the importance of temperature, ecosystem size, current and historic aquatic connectivity as well as measures of human activity (road access and land use) in determining patterns of native and introduced richness. Results Introduced species richness was positively correlated with native richness. Native and introduced richness declined with latitude, increased with temperature and ecosystem size. Variation in native richness was related to historic drainage connections, while introduced richness and salmonid dominance were significantly affected by current habitat connectivity. We found a total of 15 salmonid-free lakes, all located in remote areas south of 45 degrees S, and all upstream of major naturally occurring physical barriers. Main conclusions Temperature, as a correlate of latitude, and lake size were key determinants of native and introduced species richness in Chilean lakes and were responsible for the positive correlation between native and introduced richness. We found no evidence for biotic resistance by native species to salmonid expansion, and although the original introductions were human-mediated, current patterns of introduced richness were not related to human activity, as measured by road access or land use. Rather, environmental factors, especially habitat connectivity and temperature, appear to limit salmonid expansion within Chilean freshwaters."

So far, no quantitative information is available even for the native gastropod fauna from the laurel forests (the so-called Laurisilva) of the Canary Islands. Much of the original laurel forest has been logged in recent centuries. Based on vegetation studies, we hypothesized that densities and the number of introduced species decline with the age of the regrowth forests. We sampled 27 sites from which we collected thirty native and seven introduced species. Two introduced species, Milax nigricans and Oxychilus alliarius, were previously not reported from the Canary Islands. Assemblage composition was mainly structured by disturbance history and attitude. Overall species richness was correlated with slope inclination, prevalence of rocky outcrops, amounts of woody debris and leaf litter depth. Densities were correlated with the depth of the litter layer and the extent of herb layer cover and laurel canopy cover. Introduced species occurred in 22 sites but were neither related to native species richness nor to the time that elapsed since forest regrowth. One introduced slug, Lehmannia valentiana, is already widespread, with densities strongly related to herb cover. Overall species richness seemed to be the outcome of invasibility, thus factors enhancing species richness likely also enhance invasibility. Although at present introduced species contribute to diversity, the potential competition between introduced slugs and the rich native semi-slug fauna, and the effects of introduced predatory snails (Oxychilus spp. and Testacella maugei) warrant further monitoring.

It is unclear, however, whether this relationship is robust across spatial scales, and how a disturbance regime may affect it. Here, I examine the relationships of both richness and abundance between native and naturalized species of plants in two mediterranean scrub communities: coastal sage scrub (CSS) in California and xeric-sloped matorral (XSM) in Chile. In each vegetation type I surveyed multiple sites, where I identified vascular plant species and estimated their relative cover. Herbaceous species richness was higher in XSM, while cover of woody species was higher in CSS, where woody species have a strong impact upon herbaceous species. As there were few naturalized species with a woody growth form, the analyses performed here relate primarily to herbaceous species. Relationships between the herbaceous cover of native and naturalized species were not significant in CSS, but were nearly significant in XSM. The herbaceous species richness of native and naturalized plants were not significantly correlated on sites that had burned less than one year prior to sampling in CSS, and too few sites were available to examine this relationship in XSM. In post 1-year burn sites, however, herbaceous richness of native and naturalized species were positively correlated in both CSS and XSM. This relationship occurred at all spatial scales, from 400 m(2) to 1 m(2) plots.

Here, I examine the relationships of both richness and abundance between native and naturalized species of plants in two mediterranean scrub communities: coastal sage scrub (CSS) in California and xeric-sloped matorral (XSM) in Chile. In each vegetation type I surveyed multiple sites, where I identified vascular plant species and estimated their relative cover. Herbaceous species richness was higher in XSM, while cover of woody species was higher in CSS, where woody species have a strong impact upon herbaceous species. As there were few naturalized species with a woody growth form, the analyses performed here relate primarily to herbaceous species. Relationships between the herbaceous cover of native and naturalized species were not significant in CSS, but were nearly significant in XSM. The herbaceous species richness of native and naturalized plants were not significantly correlated on sites that had burned less than one year prior to sampling in CSS, and too few sites were available to examine this relationship in XSM. In post 1-year burn sites, however, herbaceous richness of native and naturalized species were positively correlated in both CSS and XSM.

Our previous work in serpentine ecosystems showed that native and exotic diversity are negatively correlated at small scales, but became positively correlated at larger scales. We hypothesized that this pattern was the result of classic niche partitioning at small scales where the environment is homogeneous, and a shift to the dominance of coexistence mechanisms that depend on spatial heterogeneity in the environment at large scales. Location Serpentine ecosystem, Northern California. Methods We test the above hypotheses using the phylogenetic relatedness of natives and exotics. We hypothesized that (1) at small scales, native and exotic species should be more distantly related than expected from a random assemblage model because with biotic resistance, successful invaders should have niches that are different from those of the natives present and (2) at large scales, native and exotic species should not be more distantly related than expected. Result We find strong support for the first hypothesis providing further evidence of biotic resistance at small scales. However, at large scales, native and exotic species were also more distantly related than expected. Importantly, however, natives and exotics were more distantly related at small scales than they were at large scales, suggesting that in the transition from small to large scales, biotic resistance is relaxed but still present. Communities at large scales were not saturated in the sense that more species could enter the community, increasing species richness. However, species did not invade indiscriminately. Exotic species closely related to species already established the community were excluded. Main conclusions Native communities determine the identity of exotic invaders even at large spatial scales where communities are unsaturated. These results hold promise for predicting which species will invade a community given the species present."

Exotic plant species have become increasingly prominent features of ecological landscapes throughout the world, and their interactions with native and exotic taxa in these novel environments may play critical roles in mediating the dynamics of such invasions. 2. Here, we summarize results from comparative and experimental studies that explore the effects of two factors - herbivory and facilitation - on the performance and distribution of an invasive South African grass, Ehrharta calycina, in a coastal foredune system in northern California, USA. 3. Using a 2-year exclosure experiment, we show that a native herbivore, black-tailed jackrabbits (Lepus californicus), significantly reduced the height, shoot production, fecundity and above-ground biomass of this exotic grass. 4. Data from two comparative studies and a neighbour-removal experiment revealed that Ehrharta frequently escaped herbivores by associating with three neighbouring plant species an exotic perennial grass, Ammophila arenaria, an exotic perennial succulent, Carpobrotus edulis, and a native perennial shrub, Baccharis pilularis. Ehrharta growing in association with neighbours was taller, had fewer grazed shoots, produced greater numbers of spikelets and had greater above-ground biomass than unassociated individuals. Furthermore, removing neighbours generally eliminated these benefits in 7 months, although effects differed among neighbour species. 5. An additional neighbour-removal experiment conducted in the absence of jackrabbits indicated that neighbour removals did not have significant impacts on Ehrharta height, shoot production, spikelet production or above-ground dry biomass. These results suggest that the primary means by which Ehrharta benefits from neighbouring plants is protection from herbivores - either because they are less apparent to herbivores or less accessible and that Ehrharta likely incurred minimal costs from associating with neighbours. 6. Ehrharta was more frequently associated with neighbours than expected due to chance, and less frequently found in open dune habitat. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the effects of herbivory and facilitation have been sufficiently strong to shape the local distribution of this invader in the landscape. 7. Synthesis. Our research has demonstrated that herbivory and facilitation have jointly influenced the dynamics of a biological invasion, and highlights the importance of evaluating the effects of multiple interactions on invasions in a single system."

According to the coexistence theory, native plants are able to coexist with invaders only when their fitness is not significantly smaller than that of the exotics or when they occupy a different niche. It has therefore been hypothesized that the survival of some native species at invaded sites is due to post-invasion evolutionary changes in fitness and/or niche traits. In common garden experiments, we tested whether plants from invaded sites of two native species, Impatiens noli-tangere and Galeopsis speciosa, outperform conspecifics from non-invaded sites when grown in competition with the invader (Impatiens parviflora). We further examined whether the expected superior performance of the plants from the invaded sites is due to changes in the plant size (fitness proxy) and/or changes in the germination phenology and phenotypic plasticity (niche proxies). Invasion history did not influence the performance of any native species when grown with the exotic competitor. In I. noli-tangere, however, we found significant trait divergence with regard to plant size, germination phenology and phenotypic plasticity. In the absence of a competitor, plants of I. noli-tangere from invaded sites were larger than plants from non-invaded sites. The former plants germinated earlier than inexperienced conspecifics or an exotic congener. Invasion experience was also associated with increased phenotypic plasticity and an improved shade-avoidance syndrome. Although these changes indicate fitness and niche differentiation of I. noli-tangere at invaded sites, future research should examine more closely the adaptive value of these changes and their genetic basis."

We tested the hypothesis that the invasiveness of Urochloa arrecta (non-native in the Neotropics) is negatively affected by the species richness and abundance of native aquatic macrophytes in freshwater ecosystems. We first created four levels of macrophyte richness in a greenhouse (richness experiment), and we then manipulated the densities of the same native species in a second experiment (density experiment). When the native macrophytes were adults, fragments of U. arrecta were added, and their growth was assessed. Our results from the richness experiment corroborated the hypothesis of a negative relationship between the native species richness and the growth of U. arrecta, as measured by sprout length and root biomass. However, the resistance to invasion was not attributed to the presence of a particular native species with a greater competitive ability. In the density experiment, U. arrecta growth decreased significantly with an increased density of all five of the native species. Density strongly affected the performance of the Poaceae in a negative manner, suggesting that patches that are densely colonized by native macrophytes and less subject to disturbances will be more resistant to invasion than those that are poorly colonized and more commonly subjected to disturbances. Our density experiment also showed that some species exhibit a higher competitive ability than others (sampling effect). Although native richness and abundance clearly limit the colonization and establishment of U. arrecta, these factors cannot completely prevent the invasion of aquatic ecosystems by this Poaceae species."

When comparing these introduced species with native bivalves from the same localities, Mytilus edulis and Cerastoderma edule, trematode intensity was always lower in the introduced species. These findings have three major implications: (1) introduced bivalves are not free of detrimental parasites which raises the question whether introduced species have an advantage over native species after invasion, (2) introduced bivalves may divert parasite burdens providing a relief for native species and (3) they may affect parasite populations by influencing the fate of infectious stages, ending either in dead end hosts, not being consumed by potential final hosts or by adding new hosts. Future studies should consider these implications to arrive at a better understanding of the interplay between native parasites and introduced hosts."

Here, we show that, in large collections of non-native oak trees at sites across the USA, non-native oaks introduced to regions with greater oak species richness accumulated greater leaf damage than in regions with low oak richness. Underlying this trend was the ability of herbivores to exploit non-native plants that were close relatives to their native host. In diverse oak communities, non-native trees were on average more closely related to native trees and received greater leaf damage than those in depauperate oak communities. Because insect herbivores colonize non-native plants that are similar to their native hosts, in communities with greater native plant diversity, non-natives experience greater herbivory."

While studies have examined how species loss at the local level can influence invasion resistance, interactions between species loss and other components of environmental change remain poorly studied. In particular, the manner in which native diversity interacts with resource availability to influence invasion resistance is not well understood. We created experimental plant assemblages that varied in native species (1-16 species) and/or functional richness (defined by rooting morphology and phenology; one to five functional groups). We crossed these diversity treatments with resource ( water) addition to determine their interactive effects on invasion resistance to spotted knapweed (Centaurea maculosa), a potent exotic invader in the intermountain West of the United States. We also determined how native diversity and resource addition influenced plant-available soil nitrogen, soil moisture, and light. Assemblages with lower species and functional diversity were more heavily invaded than assemblages with greater species and functional diversity. In uninvaded assemblages, experimental addition of water increased soil moisture and plant-available nitrogen and decreased light availability. The availability of these resources generally declined with increasing native plant diversity. Although water addition increased susceptibility to invasion, it did not fundamentally change the negative relationship between diversity and invasibility. Thus, native diversity provided strong invasion resistance even under high resource availability. These results suggest that the effects of local diversity can remain robust despite enhanced resource levels that are predicted under scenarios of global change."

We recorded protection status of the reefs, and abiotic variables including depth, habitat type, and wind/wave exposure at each site. We found no relationship between the density or biomass of lionfish and that of native predators.

At each scale, Spearman's correlation coefficient between native and exotic richness was calculated. We also investigated the potential for biotic homogenization by comparing all species surveyed in a wetland community (from the large sample area) with the species composition in all other wetlands using paired comparisons of their Jaccard's and Simpson's similarity indices. Results At large and medium scales, native richness was positively correlated with exotic richness, with the strength of the correlation decreasing from the large to the medium scale; at the smallest scale, the native-exotic richness correlation was negative. The average value for homogenization indices was 0.096 and 0.168, using Jaccard's and Simpson's indices, respectively, indicating that these wetland plant communities have been homogenized because of invasion by exotic species. Main Conclusions Our study demonstrated a clear shift from a positive to a negative native-exotic species richness relationship from larger to smaller spatial scales. The negative native-exotic richness relationship that we found is suggested to result from direct biotic interactions (competitive exclusion) between native and exotic species, whereas positive correlations likely reflect the more prominent influence of habitat heterogeneity on richness at larger scales. Our finding of homogenization at the community level extends conclusions from previous studies having found this pattern at much larger spatial scales. Furthermore, these results suggest that even while exhibiting a positive native-exotic richness relationship, community level biotas can/are still being homogenized because of exotic species invasion."

At fine spatial scales, native-exotic richness relationships should be negative as higher native richness confers resistance to invasion. At broad scales, relationships should be positive if natives and exotics respond similarly to extrinsic factors. Yet few studies have examined both native and exotic richness patterns across gradients of human influence, where impacts could affect native and exotic species differently. We examined native-exotic richness relationships and extrinsic drivers of plant species richness and distributions across an urban development gradient in remnant oak savanna patches. In sharp contrast to most reported results, we found a negative relationship at the regional scale, and no relationship at the local scale. The negative regional-scale relationship was best explained by extrinsic factors, surrounding road density and climate, affecting natives and exotics in opposite ways, rather than a direct effect of native on exotic richness, or vice versa. Models of individual species distributions also support the result that road density and climate have largely opposite effects on native and exotic species, although simple life history traits (life form, dispersal mode) do not predict which habitat characteristics are important for particular species. Roads likely influence distributions and species richness by increasing both exotic propagule pressure and disturbance to native species. Climate may partially explain the negative relationship due to differing climatic preferences within the native and exotic species pools. As gradients of human influence are increasingly common, negative broad-scale native-exotic richness relationships may be frequent in such landscapes."

Disruption of native ant communities following invasion by the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) is widely reported to lead indirectly to the near complete collapse of seed dispersal services. In coastal scrub in southeastern Australia, we examined seed dispersal and handling of two native and two invasive alien plant species at Argentine ant-invaded or -uninvaded sites. The Argentine ant virtually eliminates the native keystone disperser Rhytidoponera victoriae, but seed dispersal did not collapse following invasion. Indeed, Argentine ants directly accounted for 92% of all ant-seed interactions and sustained overall seed dispersal rates. Nevertheless, dispersal quantity and quality among seed species differed between Argentine ant-invaded and -uninvaded sites. Argentine ants removed significantly fewer native Acacia retinodes seeds, but significantly more small seeds of invasive Polygala myrtifolia than did native ants at uninvaded sites. They also handled significantly more large seeds of A. sophorae, but rarely moved them >5 cm, instead recruiting en masse, consuming elaiosomes piecemeal and burying seeds in situ. In contrast, Argentine ants transported and interred P. myrtifolia seeds in their shallow nests. Experiments with artificial diaspores that varied in diaspore and elaiosome masses, but kept seed morphology and elaiosome quality constant, showed that removal by L. humile depended on the interaction of seed size and percentage elaiosome reward. Small diaspores were frequently taken, independent of high or low elaiosome reward, but large artificial diaspores with high reward instead elicited mass recruitment by Argentine ants and were rarely moved. Thus, Argentine ants appear to favour some diaspore types and reject others based largely on diaspore size and percentage reward. Such variability in response indirectly reduces native seed dispersal and can directly facilitate the spread of an invasive alien shrub."

Here, we examine interactions among two pairs of invasive crayfish species because of their close proximity and thus chance of sympatric populations in the near future within the Thames catchment, U.K. (signal, Pacifastacus leniusculus and virile crayfish, Orconectes virilis within a river system; red swamp, Procambarus clarkii and Turkish crayfish, Astacus leptodactylus found within a suite of ponds). We address two questions: do sympatric invasive crayfish occupy a smaller niche than their allopatric counterparts due to potential resource competition? and do interactions among invasive species amplify or mitigate one another's impacts on the ecosystem? Two fully factorial mesocosm experiments (one for each crayfish pair) were used to investigate crayfish diet and their impact on benthic invertebrate community structure, benthic algal standing stock and leaf litter decomposition rates in allopatric and sympatric populations, compared with a crayfish-free control. We used stable isotope analysis to examine crayfish diet in the mesocosms and in allopatric populations of each species in the Thames catchment. Isotopic niche width did not vary significantly between allopatric and sympatric populations of crayfish in the mesocosm experiments, and isotopic niche partitioning in all the wild populations suggests the invaders can coexist. All four species altered benthic invertebrate community structure but with differing functional effects, often mediated via trophic cascades. Red swamp crayfish predation upon snails evidently promoted benthic algal standing stock via reduction in grazing pressure. However, a trophic cascade whereby the crayfish consumed native invertebrate shredders, causing a reduction in net leaf litter decomposition, was decoupled by red swamp and signal crayfish since they consumed leaf litter directly and thus moderated the cascade to a trickle when in sympatry with Turkish or virile crayfish, respectively. Benthic invertebrate predator abundance was significantly reduced by sympatric red swamp and Turkish crayfish but not independently when in allopatry, indicating an amplified effect overall when in sympatry. Our results suggest that the combined effect of multiple invasions on the ecosystem can reflect either an additive effect of their independent impacts or an amplified effect, which is greater than the sum of their independent impacts. A lack of general pattern in their effects makes any potential management strategy more complex."

Mechanisms include greater resource acquisition rates and greater plasticity in resource acquisition by invasive exotic species compared to non-invasive natives. We assess the support for these mechanisms by comparing nitrate acquisition and growth of invasive annual and perennial grass seedlings in western North America. Two invasive exotic grasses (Bromus tectorum and Taeniatherum caput-medusae) and three perennial native and exotic grasses (Pseudoroegneria spicata, Elymus elymoides, and Agropyron cristatum) were grown at various temperatures typical of autumn and springtime when resource are abundant and dominance is determined by rapid growth and acquisition of resources. Bromus tectorum and perennial grasses had similar rates of nitrate acquisition at low temperature, but acquisition by B. tectorum significantly exceeded perennial grasses at higher temperature. Consequently, B. tectorum had the highest acquisition plasticity, showcasing its ability to take advantage of transient warm periods in autumn and spring. Nitrate acquisition by perennial grasses was limited either by root production or rate of acquisition per unit root mass, suggesting a trade-off between nutrient acquisition and allocation of growth to structural tissues. Our results indicate the importance of plasticity in resource acquisition when temperatures are warm such as following autumn emergence by B. tectorum. Highly flexible and opportunistic nitrate acquisition appears to be a mechanism whereby invasive annual grasses exploit soil nitrogen that perennials cannot use."

Here, we evaluated available data on the role of MS in marine and estuarine communities and their interactions with other anthropogenic stressors, using an intensive analysis of the Chesapeake Bay region as a case study. First, we reviewed the reported ecological impacts of 196 species that occur in tidal waters of the bay, including species that are known invaders as well as some that are cryptogenic (i.e., of uncertain origin). Second, we compared the impacts reported in and out of the bay region for the same 54 species of plants and fish from this group that regularly occur in the region's tidal waters. Third, we assessed the evidence for interaction in the distribution or performance of these 54 plant and fish species within the bay and other stressors. Of the 196 known and possible NIS, 39 (20%) were thought to have some significant impact on a resident population, community, habitat, or process within the bay region. However, quantitative data on impacts were found for only 12 of the 39, representing 31% of this group and 6% of all 196 species surveyed. The patterns of reported impacts in the bay for plants and fish were nearly identical: 29% were reported to have significant impacts, but quantitative impact data existed for only 7% (4/54) of these species. In contrast, 74% of the same species were reported to have significant impacts outside of the bay, and some quantitative impact data were found for 44% (24/54) of them. Although it appears that 20% of the plant and fish species in our analysis may have significant impacts in the bay region based upon impacts measured elsewhere, we suggest that studies outside the region cannot reliably predict such impacts. We surmise that quantitative impact measures for individual bays or estuaries generally exist for <5% of the NIS present, and many of these measures are not particularly informative. Despite the increasing knowledge of marine invasions at many sites, it is evident that we understand little about the full extent and variety of the impacts they create-singly and cumulatively. Given the multiple anthropogenic stressors that overlap with NIS in estuaries, we predict NIS-stressor interactions play an important role in the pattern and impact of invasions."

Most ENI bird species are established locally; a few are spreading or widespread. There has been a recent large increase in establishment. All ENI birds are of tropical origin, mostly from the Ethiopian and Oriental regions; the main families are Sturnidae, Psittacidae, Anatidae, and Columbidae. Most species have been deliberately brought to Israel in captivity and subsequently released or escaped. Most of these birds are commensal with humans to some degree, are not typically migratory, and have mean body mass larger than that of the entire order. ENI birds are not distributed randomly. There are centers in the Tel-Aviv area and along the Rift Valley, which is also a corridor of spread. Positive correlations were found between ENI bird richness and mean annual temperature and urbanization. Mediterranean forests and desert regions have fewer ENI species than expected.

In this study, earthworms, seed banks, and the standing vegetation were sampled in a grassland of central California. Our objectives were i) to examine whether the abundances of non-native, invasive earthworm species and non-native grassland plant species are correlated, and ii) to test whether seed ingestion by these worms alters the soil seed bank by evaluating the composition of seeds in casts relative to uningested soil. Sampling locations were selected based on historical land-use practices, including presence or absence of tilling, and revegetation by seed using Phalaris aquatica. Only non-native earthworm species were found, dominated by the invasive European species Aporrectodea trapezoides. Earthworm abundance was significantly higher in the grassland blocks dominated by non-native plant species, and these sites had higher carbon and moisture contents. Earthworm abundance was also positively related to increased emergence of non-native seedlings, but had no effect on that of native seedlings. Plant species richness and total seedling emergence were higher in casts than in uningested soils. This study suggests that there is a potential effect of non-native earthworms in promoting non-native and likely invasive plant species within grasslands, due to seed-plant-earthworm interactions via soil modification or to seed ingestion by earthworms and subsequent cast effects on grassland dynamics. This study supports a growing body of literature for earthworms as ecosystem engineers but highlights the relative importance of considering non-native-native interactions with the associated plant community.

Additionally, a mosaic environment of engineered and non-engineered habitats has been shown to increase biodiversity. Non-native ecosystem engineers can be introduced into environments that do not contain or have lost species that form biogenic habitat, resulting in dramatic impacts upon native communities. Yet, little is known about how non-native ecosystem engineers interact with natives and other non-natives already present in the environment, specifically whether non-native ecosystem engineers facilitate other non-natives, and whether they increase habitat heterogeneity and alter the diversity, abundance, and distribution of benthic species. Through sampling and experimental removal of reefs, we examine the effects of a non-native reef-building tubeworm, Ficopomatus enigmaticus, on community composition in the central Californian estuary, Elkhorn Slough. Tubeworm reefs host significantly greater abundances of many non-native polychaetes and amphipods, particularly the amphipods Monocorophium insidiosum and Melita nitida, compared to nearby mudflats. Infaunal assemblages under F. enigmaticus reefs and around reef's edges show very low abundance and taxonomic diversity. Once reefs are removed, the newly exposed mudflat is colonized by opportunistic non-native species, such as M. insidiosum and the polychaete Streblospio benedicti, making removal of reefs a questionable strategy for control. These results show that provision of habitat by a non-native ecosystem engineer may be a mechanism for invasional meltdown in Elkhorn Slough, and that reefs increase spatial heterogeneity in the abundance and composition of benthic communities."

Positive interactions between non-native, habitat-creating species and non-native species utilizing such habitats could be a mechanism for enhanced invasion success. Most previous studies on aquatic invasive habitat-creating species have demonstrated positive responses in associated communities, but few have directly addressed responses of other non-native species. We explored the association of native and non-native species with invasive habitat-creating species by comparing communities associated with non-native, reef-building tubeworms Ficopomatus enigmaticus and native oysters Ostrea conchaphila in Elkhorn Slough, a central California estuary. Non-native habitat supported greater densities of associated organisms-primarily highly abundant non-native amphipods (e.g. Monocorophium insidiosum, Melita nitida), tanaid (Sinelebus sp.), and tube-dwelling polychaetes (Polydora spp.). Detritivores were the most common trophic group, making up disproportionately more of the community associated with F. enigmaticus than was the case in the O. conchaphila community. Analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) showed that native species' community structure varied significantly among sites, but not between biogenic habitats. In contrast, non-natives varied with biogenic habitat type, but not with site. Thus, reefs of the invasive tubeworm F. enigmaticus interact positively with other non-native species."

A significantly greater number of non-native plant species occurred at the urban sites and at one site at the urban-rural interface, where 20 to 33% of the species encountered were non-native. In contrast, at the more rural sites non-native species comprised 4-14% of the total number of species. However, the importance values of non-native species as a whole did not change significantly across the land use gradient due to the high frequency and abundance of three non-native species (Ligustrum sinense, Lonicera japonica, and Microstegium vimineum) in the majority of the watersheds. Reductions in species richness and overstory reproduction associated with these non-natives could impact long-term forest structure and ecosystem function."

Previous studies have shown that invasive range expansion is often related to the invader's life histories and dispersal behavior. Among behavioral traits, boldness is a key trait that may aid species in performing well in novel environments. Thus, along a species' invaded range, individuals from the invasion front should be bolder, better dispersers, and have life histories that maximize population growth relative to established populations. We tested these hypotheses with the invasion of the African jewelfish Hemichromis letourneuxi in Everglades National Park (ENP). Jewelfish entered ENP in 2000, and since then they have expanded their range rapidly but traceably. Our study examined variation in reproductive investment, body condition, gut fullness, boldness, and dispersal behavior across six wild-caught populations of African jewelfish. Boldness and dispersal were tested using an emergence-activity test and an emergence-dispersal test in large, outdoor experimental setups. We dissected fish from the six populations to assess life histories. Populations from the invasion front (western ENP) had higher reproductive investment, higher gut fullness, and better body condition, but they were not relatively bolder nor better dispersers than inner populations (eastern ENP). As the invasion progressed, lower intraspecific density at the invasion front may have relaxed competition and allowed for higher fitness and reproductive investment. Understanding underlying behavioral and life-history mechanisms of an invasion is key for the development of management strategies that aim to contain current invaders and prevent the spread of future ones."

To identify traits conferring an advantage to Norway maple, we grew both species through an entire growing season under simulated light regimes mimicking a closed forest understorey vs. a canopy disturbance (gap). Dynamic shade-houses providing a succession of high-intensity direct-light events between longer periods of low, diffuse light were used to simulate the light regimes. We assessed seedling height growth three times in the season, as well as stem diameter, maximum photosynthetic capacity, biomass allocation above- and below-ground, seasonal phenology and phenotypic plasticity. Given the north European provenance of Norway maple, we also investigated the possibility that its growth in North America might be increased by delayed fall senescence. We found that Norway maple had significantly greater photosynthetic capacity in both light regimes and grew larger in stem diameter than sugar maple. The differences in below- and above-ground biomass, stem diameter, height and maximum photosynthesis were especially important in the simulated gap where Norway maple continued extension growth during the late fall. In the gap regime sugar maple had a significantly higher root : shoot ratio that could confer an advantage in the deepest shade of closed understorey and under water stress or browsing pressure. Norway maple is especially invasive following canopy disturbance where the opposite (low root : shoot ratio) could confer a competitive advantage. Considering the effects of global change in extending the potential growing season, we anticipate that the invasiveness of Norway maple will increase in the future."

Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides and Brazilian waterweed Egeria densa are introduced species in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta (the Delta) of California, a highly modified estuary. In this system, Brazilian waterweed and Largemouth Bass have seen marked increases in distribution and abundance in recent decades, but their association has not been specifically studied until now. We conducted a 2-year, bimonthly electrofishing survey with simultaneous sampling of water quality and submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) biomass at 33 locations throughout the Delta. We used generalized linear mixed models to assess the relative influences of water temperature, conductivity, Secchi depth, and SAV biomass density on the abundance of both juvenile-sized and larger Largemouth Bass. Water temperature had a positive relationship with the abundance of both size-classes, but only juvenile-sized fish had a positive association with SAV biomass density, with highest abundances at intermediate SAV densities. In contrast, larger fish were generally ubiquitous across all sampling conditions, even when SAV was absent or present at low densities. Our results on the Largemouth Bass-SAV relationship are consistent with those of previous studies from lake systems within the Largemouth Bass's native range, where they interact with a different SAV species assemblage. These results are supportive of the hypothesis that the proliferation of Brazilian waterweed has expanded Largemouth Bass rearing habitat in the Delta. Finally, this study has implications for tidal wetland restoration plans for the Delta, suggesting that the larger-sized Largemouth Bass may still inhabit restored areas even if invasive SAV establishment is limited."

Physical impacts of hurricanes were hypothesized to promote invasion and growth of L. microphyllum. We compared presence and density of L. microphyllum in plots of disturbed soil created by hurricane-caused treefalls to randomly selected non-disturbed plots on 12 tree islands. We also examined relationships between disturbed area size, canopy cover, and presence of standing water on presence and density of L. microphyllum. Lygodium microphyllum was present in significantly more treefall plots than random non-treefall plots (76% of the treefall plots (N = 55) and only 14% of random non-treefall plots (N = 55)). Density of L. microphyllum was higher in treefall plots compared to random non-disturbed plots (6.0 sterns per m(2) for treefall plots: 0.5 stems per m(2) for random non-disturbed plots), and L. microphyllum density was correlated with disturbed area size (P = 0.005). Lygodium microphyllum presence in treefall sites was significantly related to canopy cover and presence of water: it was present in five times more treefalls with water than those without. These results suggest that disturbances, such as hurricanes, that result in canopy openings and the creation of disturbed areas with standing water contribute to the ability of L. microphyllum to invade natural areas."

This is an area of concern, as the deliberate or accidental release of pets is an important pathway by which exotic species are often introduced into new environments, often with negative effects on the local species and ecosystems. Internet trading sites were used to determine the distribution and magnitude of propagule pressure of red-eared slider turtles (RES; Trachemys scripta elegans) within the New Zealand pet trade. Sites were tracked daily from October 1, 2007 to September 30, 2009 and information on age, sex, season, and location was recorded. More than 1,500 sales and 80 reports of lost/found RES were recorded. Unsurprisingly, the highest number of sales and lost/found RES was in Auckland, the region with the highest human population. Females were more often reported as lost or found than males, despite a similar sex ratio of sales. The type and quality of information gathered in this manner is not perfect, as it only provides an estimate of minimum numbers of animals that are being traded/lost into the environment, but nonetheless, provides useful data when planning a management or eradication plan for feral turtles in New Zealand. Of concern, our results highlighted areas where turtles were most often being released in New Zealand, being those areas predicted to be the most climatically-suitable for this species, and in which incubation conditions were most likely to be met. Monitoring online sales of exotic species provides useful demographic information, as well as an indication of propagule pressure via the pet-release pathway. This technique is applicable to other species and may be a useful tool to help determine locations at risk of the establishment of other exotic species."

Comparing patches (1 m(2)) within 17 Quercus-dominated stands (each 1 ha, within a 100 km by 150 km area), cover of young R. cathartica was negatively related to both species richness and cover of native species. In 1 m(2) patches, native cover was positively associated with native richness and thus cover-related competition was a likely mechanism by which richness influenced R. cathartica. At the landscape scale (comparing the aggregate stand-scale metrics among the 17 stands), native cover and richness were still positively related, but had opposite relationships with R. cathartica cover. R. cathartica cover was positively related to species richness and negatively related to native species cover. The observed switch at different scales from a positive to a negative relationship between R. cathartica cover and native richness supported the hypothesized scale dependence of these relations. Propagule pressure, which we estimated by measuring the size of nearby mature R. cathartica shrubs, had a large positive effect on R. cathartica seedling cover at the landscape scale. These results suggest that landscape patterns of invasion may be best understood in light of the combination of many factors including native diversity, native cover, and propagule pressure."

Multiple invasive species interact in complex and unpredictable ways, altering their invasion success and impacts on biodiversity. Incumbent invasive species can be replaced by functionally similar invading species through competitive processes; however the generalized circumstances leading to such competitive displacement have not been well investigated. The likelihood of competitive displacement is a function of the incumbent advantage of the resident invasive species and the propagule pressure of the colonizing invasive species. We modeled interactions between populations of two functionally similar invasive species and indicated the circumstances under which dominance can be through propagule pressure and incumbent advantage. Under certain circumstances, a normally subordinate species can be incumbent and reject a colonizing dominant species, or successfully colonize in competition with a dominant species during simultaneous invasion. Our theoretical results are supported by empirical studies of the invasion of islands by three invasive Rattus species. Competitive displacement is prominent in invasive rats and explains the replacement of R. exulans on islands subsequently invaded by European populations of R. rattus and R. norvegicus. These competition outcomes between invasive species can be found in a broad range of taxa and biomes, and are likely to become more common. Conservation management must consider that removing an incumbent invasive species may facilitate invasion by another invasive species. Under very restricted circumstances of dominant competitive ability but lesser impact, competitive displacement may provide a novel method of biological control."

Thus, nonnative species can harm a trophically similar native species by competing with them more intensely than other native species. However, nonnative species may only be able initially to invade habitats in which resource overlap with native species is small. The nonnative slug Arion subfuscus exists in close sympatry with the native philomycid slugs Philomycus carolinianus and Megapallifera mutabilis in central Maryland forests. Resource use by most terrestrial gastropods is poorly known, but seems to suggest high dietary and macrohabitat overlap, potentially placing native gastropod species at high risk of competitive pressure from invading species. However, A. subfuscus was introduced to North America 150 years ago, supporting the possibility that A. subfuscus initially entered an empty niche. We tested the hypothesis that P. carolinianus and M. mutabilis would exhibit greater overlap in food and microhabitat use with A. subfuscus than they would with each other. We established food preferences by examining the faecal material of wild-caught slugs, distinguishing food types and quantifying them by volume on a microgrid. We determined microhabitat preferences by surveying the substrates of slugs in the field. The overlap in substrate and food resources was greater between A. subfuscus and P. carolinianus than between the two native species. However, substrate choice was correlated with local substrate availability for P. carolinianus, suggesting flexibility in habitat use, and the slight overlap in food use between A. subfuscus and P. carolinianus may be low enough to minimize competition."

Curlew Valley, a site in Northern Utah, provides a model community to test the effects of particular species on invasion by examining competitive relationships among Elymus , Bromus and the native shrub Artemisia tridentata . 2 The site contains Bromus /Elymus , Elymus /Artemisia and monodominant Elymus stands. Transect data indicate that Elymus suppresses Bromus disproportionately relative to its above-ground cover. Artemisia seedlings recruit in Elymus stands but rarely in the presence of Bromus . This relationship might be explained by competition between the two grasses involving a different resource or occurring in a different season to that between each grass and Artemisia . 3 Time reflectometry data collected in monodominant patches indicated that in spring, soil moisture use by Bromus is rapid, whereas depletion under Elymus and Artemisia is more moderate. Artemisia seedlings may therefore encounter a similar moisture environment in monodominant or mixed perennial stands. However, efficient autumn soil moisture use by Elymus may help suppress Bromus . 4 In competition plots, target Artemisia grown with Bromus were stunted relative to those grown with Elymus , despite equivalent above-ground biomass of the two grasses. Competition for nitrogen in spring and autumn, assessed with (15) N tracer, appears to be secondary to moisture availability in determining competitive outcomes. 5 Elymus physiology and function appear to play an important role in determining the composition of communities in Curlew Valley, by maintaining zones free of Bromus where Artemisia can recruit."

We collected parasite data on 160 individual coqui frogs collected during January-April 2006 from eight populations in Puerto Rico and Hawaii. Puerto Rican coqui frogs had higher species richness of parasites than Hawaiian coqui frogs.

Given that invasions may cause ecological and economic damage and pose a major threat to biodiversity, understanding the mechanisms behind invasion success is essential. Both the release of non-native populations from natural enemies, such as parasites, and the genetic diversity of these populations may play key roles in their invasion success. We investigated the roles of parasite communities, through enemy release and parasite acquisition, and genetic diversity in the invasion success of the non-native bumblebee, Bombus hypnorum, in the United Kingdom. The invasive B.hypnorum had higher parasite prevalence than most, or all native congeners for two high-impact parasites, probably due to higher susceptibility and parasite acquisition. Consequently parasites had a higher impact on B.hypnorum queens' survival and colony-founding success than on native species. Bombus hypnorum also had lower functional genetic diversity at the sex-determining locus than native species. Higher parasite prevalence and lower genetic diversity have not prevented the rapid invasion of the United Kingdom by B.hypnorum. These data may inform our understanding of similar invasions by commercial bumblebees around the world. This study suggests that concerns about parasite impacts on the small founding populations common to re-introduction and translocation programs may be less important than currently believed."

Location North American east and west coasts with a focus on San Francisco Bay (SFB). Methods Species richness and prevalence of trematode parasites were examined in the native and introduced ranges of two gastropod host species, Ilyanassa obsoleta and Littorina saxatilis. We divided the native range into the putative source area for introduction and areas to the north and south; we also sampled the overlapping introduced range in SFB. We dissected 14,781 snails from 103 populations and recorded the prevalence and identity of trematode parasites. We compared trematode species richness and prevalence across the hosts' introduced and native ranges, and evaluated the influence of host availability on observed patterns. Results Relative to the native range, both I. obsoleta and L. saxatilis have escaped (lost) parasites in SFB, and L. saxatilis demonstrated a greater reduction of trematode diversity and infection prevalence than I. obsoleta. This was not due to sampling inequalities between the hosts. Instead, rarefaction curves suggested complete capture of trematode species in native source and SFB subregions, except for L. saxatilis in SFB, where infection was extremely rare. For I. obsoleta, infection prevalence of trematodes using fish definitive hosts was significantly lower in SFB compared to the native range, unlike those using bird hosts. Host availability partly explained the presence of introduced trematodes in SFB. Main conclusions Differential losses of parasite richness and prevalence for the two gastropod host species in their introduced range is probably the result of several mechanistic factors: time since introduction, propagule pressure, vector of introduction, and host availability. Moreover, the recent occurrence of L. saxatilis' invasion and its active introduction vector suggest that its parasite diversity and distribution will probably increase over time. Our study suggests that host invasion history and parasite life history play key roles in the extent and diversity of trematodes transferred to introduced populations. Our results also provide vital information for understanding community-level influences of parasite introductions, as well as for disease ecology in general."

Comparison of the mean numbers of parasite species and genera per population for each fish species England and Wales with their native ranges revealed <9 % of the native parasite fauna were present in their populations in England and Wales. There was no evidence suggesting these introduced parasites had spilled over into sympatric native fishes. The non-native fishes did acquire parasites following their introduction, providing potential for parasite spill-back to sympatric fishes, and resulted in non-significant differences in overall mean numbers of parasites per populations between the two ranges. Through this acquisition, the non-native fishes also had mean numbers of parasite species and genera per population that were not significantly different to sympatric native fishes. Thus, the non-native fishes in England and Wales showed evidence of enemy release, acquired new parasites following introduction providing potential for spill-back, but showed no evidence of parasite spill-over."

The reasons for its success in saline habitats, and low abundance in low salinity habitats, are poorly known. Here we explore the potential role of water mites, which are typical parasites of hemipterans, in the invasion dynamics of T. v. verticalis. We compared infection levels between T. v. verticalis and the natives Sigara lateralis (Leach, 1817) and S. scripta (Rambur, 1840). No mites were found in saline wetlands where T. v. verticalis is highly dominant. Larvae of two mite species were identified infecting corixids in habitats of lower salinity: Hydrachna skorikowi and Eylais infundibulifera. Total parasite prevalence and prevalence of E. infundibulifera were significantly higher in T. v. verticalis compared with S. lateralis and S. scripta. Mean abundance of total infection and of E. infundibulifera and H. skorikowi were also higher in T. v. verticalis. When infected with H. skorikowi, native species harbored only one or two parasite individuals, while the smaller T. v. verticalis carried up to seven mites. When infected with E. infundibulifera, native species harboured only one parasite individual, while T. v. verticalis carried up to 6. Mite size didn't differ among host species, suggesting that all are suitable for engorgement. Both mite species showed a negative correlation between prevalence and salinity. T. v. verticalis susceptibility to parasitic mites may explain its low abundance in low salinity habitats, and may contribute to the conservation of native corixids. The success of T. v. verticalis in saline wetlands may be partly explained by the absence of parasitic mites, which are less halotolerant."

The parasite fauna of N. melanostomus, B. gymnotrachelus, and P. semilunaris consists of 23, 22, and 15 taxa, respectively. The species accumulation curves show stable accumulation of parasite species by all four fish hosts along the studied part of the corridor, from the Dnieper Estuary to the Vistula River delta. The plot reveals also that the studied gobies lose the parasites common in the host native range and accept new parasites from the colonized area. In the case of N. melanostomus, it complies with the enemy release hypothesis, as the parasite load was low in the invaded area if compared to the native range. The three other alien gobies are vector for Gyrodactylus proterorhini in the Baltic basin. Moreover, populations of this alien monogenean tend to be more abundant in their new range in comparison with the Black Sea basin. In general, the number of parasite species in the colonized area was of the same rank as in the native one for N. fluviatilis, and even higher for B. gymnotrachelus. This results from accumulating new parasite species along the gobiid invasion route. In particular, the N. fluviatilis, B. gymnotrachelus, and P. semilunaris lost some of their native parasites and gained the local ones after entering the post-dam part of the Vistula River; it can be interpreted as a partial escape from parasites."

I conducted a comparative study of establishment success in global fish introductions, controlling for regional geographic differences, to test these hypothesized correlates. 3. In 133 introductions of 17 fish species, establishment success was negatively associated with fecundity while there was no evidence for an effect of relative brain size. In analysis of partially overlapping data, there was no evidence of a correlation between relative brain size and establishment rate across 39 species. 4. One explanation for the negative association with fecundity is that parental investment might be more important to establishment than fecundity. In 126 introductions of 14 species, reproductive behaviours associated with parental investment were significantly associated with establishment success. These results suggest that the correlation between brain size and establishment success is not universal."

Along these lines, the speed with which the Caribbean-Atlantic barnacle Chthamalus proteus became widespread in Hawaii has been attributed to the availability of settlement space in the intertidal zone.

At a third site, where recruitment was the highest, competition between C proteus and an early invader, Amphibalanus reticulatus, in the form of space pre-emption was occurring, apparently mediated-at least in part by the preference of A. reticulatus to settle near conspecifics. C proteus and the native barnacle Nesochthamalus intertextus displayed no such settlement preference. Earlier studies linked differences in recruitment rates of barnacles and other invertebrate species on Oahu to differences in circulation patterns that bring offshore waters into shore at some sites and hold near-shore water flowing out of lagoons and harbors close to shore in others. The present study adds to a growing body of work that suggests that while the relative importance of pre-settlement vs. post-settlement factors to invasion success varies with location, knowledge of local oceanographic conditions could help predict the spread of non-native marine species.

This hypothesis accords well with the observation that, of the 41 species introduced on more than one of the Hawaiian islands, all but four either succeeded everywhere they were introduced or failed everywhere they were introduced, no matter what other species or how many other species were present. Other hypotheses, including competitive ones, are possible. However, most other patterns that have been claimed to support the hypothesis that competitive interactions have been key to which species survived are ambiguous. We propose that the following patterns are true: (1) Extinction rate as a function of number of species present (S) is not better fit by addition of an S2 term. (2) Bill-length differences between pairs of species that invaded together may tend to be less for pairs in which at least one species became extinct, but the result is easily changed by use of one reasonable set of conventions rather than another. In any event, the relationship of bill-length differences to resource overlap has not been established for these species. (3) Surviving forest passeriforms on Oahu may be overdispersed in morphological space, although the species pool used to construct the space may not have been the correct one.

Lists of vascular plant species were obtained for each reserve, alien species were divided into archaeophytes and neophytes (introduced before and after 1500, respectively). The statistical analysis using general linear models made it possible to identify the effects of particular variables. Flora representation by neophytes decreased with altitude (explained 23.8% of variance) while, with archaeophytes, the effect of altitude depended on their interaction with native species in particular vegetation types. The proportion of neophytes increased with increasing density of human population. Both the number and proportion of aliens plants significantly increased with increasing number of native species in a reserve. This relationship was affected by altitude, and after filtering out this variable, the effect remained positive for neophytes but became negative for archaeophytes in humid grasslands. The positive relationship between neophytes and native species is not a mere side effect of species-area relationship of native flora, but indicates that the two groups do not directly compete. Vegetation type alone explained 14.2 and 55.5% of variation in proportion of aliens in regions of mesophilous and mountain flora, respectively. Humid grasslands were the least invaded vegetation type. Positioning the reserve within large protected sections of landscape significantly decreases probability of it being invaded by potentially invasive alien species. Within the context of SLOSS debate, a new model - several small inside single large (SSISL) - is suggested as an appropriate solution from the viewpoint of plant invasions to nature reserves.

Richness and cover of non-native species were highest at the edges of the remnant and declined to relatively uniform levels within the remnant. Native species richness and cover were lowest at the edge adjoining a roadside but then showed little relation to distance from edge. Roadside edge quadrats were floristically distinct from most other quadrats when ordinated by Detrended Correspondence Analysis. Soil phosphorus was significantly higher at the roadside edge but did not vary within the remnant itself. All other abiotic factors measured (NH4, NO3, S, pH and % organic carbon) showed little variation across the remnant. Non-native species richness and cover were strongly correlated with soil phosphorus levels. Native species were negatively correlated with soil phosphorus levels. Canonical Correspondence Analysis identified the perennial non-native grasses of high biomass as species most dependent on high soil nutrient levels. Such species may be resource-limited in undisturbed soils. Three classes of non-native plants have invaded this species-rich grassland. (1) generalist species (greater than or equal to 50 % frequency), mostly therophytes with non-specialized habitat or germination requirements; (2) resource-limited species comprising perennial species of high biomass that are dependent on nutrient increases and/or soil disturbances before they can invade the community and; (3) species of intermediate frequency (1-30 %), of low to high biomass potential, that appear to have non-specialized habitat requirements but are currently limited by seed dispersal, seedling establishment or the current site management. Native species richness and cover are most negatively affected by increases in non-native cover. Declines are largely evident once the non-native cover exceeds 40 %. Widespread, generalist non-native species are numerous in intact sites and will have to be considered a permanent part of the flora of remnant grasslands. Management must aim to minimize increases in cover of any non-native species or the disturbances that favour the establishment of competitive nonnative grasses if the native grassland flora is to be conserved in small, fragmented remnants."

We found direct evidence that extrinsic forces are more important predictors of successful invasion. Species introduced when fewer other species were present were more likely to be successful. In a direct test of the alternative hypothesis that intrinsic forces play a more prominent role in success or failure, we found a tendency for species which successfully established on Saint Helena to be also successful when introduced elsewhere. However, the vast majority of species unsuccessful at establishing on Saint Helena had probabilities of success outside Saint Helena of 50% or greater, making this result somewhat equivocal. Finally, we found no evidence to support the hypothesis that species that are successful early are those that are intrinsically superior invaders.

Yet despite the diversity of road types, there is little research on the influence of these types on the spread of invaders. Common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia), a plant producing large amounts of allergenic pollen, was selected as a species model for examining the impact of road type on the spread of invasive plants. We examined this relationship in an agricultural region of Quebec, Canada. We mapped plant distribution along different road types, and constructed a model of species presence. Common ragweed was found in almost all sampling sites located along regional (97%) and local paved (81%) roads. However, verges of unpaved local roads were rarely (13%) colonized by the plant. A model (53% of variance explained), constructed with only four variables (paved regional roads, paved local roads, recently mown road verges, forest cover), correctly predicted (success rate: 89%) the spatial distribution of common ragweed. Results support the hypothesis that attributes associated with paved roads strongly favour the spread of an opportunistic invasive plant species. Specifically, larger verges and greater disturbance associated with higher traffic volume create propitious conditions for common ragweed. To date, emphasis has been placed on controlling the plant in agricultural fields, even though roadsides are probably a much larger seed source. Strategies for controlling the weed along roads have only focused on major highways, even though the considerable populations along local roads also contribute to the production of pollen. Management prioritizations developed to control common ragweed are thus questionable."

Often with the assumption that once these resources are spent and the invader is successfully removed, the impact of that species on the community is also eliminated. However, invasive species may change the environment in ways that persist, as legacy effects, after the species itself is gone. Here we evaluate the persistence of soil legacy effects following the death of Cytisus scoparius, an invasive nitrogen-fixer. In a field experiment, we periodically killed C. scoparius with herbicide, so that by the end of 2 years the invader had been absent from plots for different durations of time (22, 10, and 1 month). After the final C. scoparius removal treatment, we measured available soil nitrogen and phosphorus as well as the abundance of native and exotic vegetation. We planted Douglas-fir seedlings into the removal plots and tracked seedling success. One month after C. scoparius removal, there was a soil legacy effect in the form of a large initial pulse of inorganic N, presumably as a result of rapid decomposition of N-rich C. scoparius biomass. In the 10-month removal plots, this initial pulse of N had declined dramatically and was 70 % less than the invaded state. However, over the following year, there was little additional decline of N. Time since C. scoparius removal also affected Douglas-fir seedling growth, where seedlings planted into areas where C. scoparius had been removed for 22 months were smaller than seedlings planted into areas where C. scoparius had been removed for 1 and 10 months. This pattern may be caused by competition from a second wave of exotic invaders, whose cover increased with time following C. scoparius removal. Rather than providing a lasting positive fertilization effect on native vegetation, our results suggest that increased N availability instead favors the invasion of fast-growing, nitrophyllic exotic grasses and forbs, and that these species limit colonization and growth of native vegetation including the locally dominant tree Douglas-fir."

In this study, the effect of plant canopies on the establishment of P. arundinacea from seed in a fen, fen-like mesocosms, and a fen restoration site was assessed. In Wingra Fen, canopies that were more resistant to P. arundinacea establishment had more species (eight or nine versus four to six species) and higher cover of Aster firmus. In mesocosms planted with Glyceria striata plus 1, 6, or 15 native species, all canopies closed rapidly and prevented P. arundinacea establishment from seed, regardless of the density of the matrix species or the number of added species. Only after gaps were created in the canopy was P. arundinacea able to establish seedlings; then, the 15-species treatment reduced establishment to 48% of that for single-species canopies. A similar experiment in the restoration site produced less cover of native plants, and P. arundinacea recruited more readily. Results suggest that, where conditions are favorable for native plant growth, even species-poor canopies can inhibit P. arundinacea establishment from seed, but when disturbances create gaps, species-rich canopies confer greater resistance to invasion."

The xeric population exhibited a highly constrained phenology and was unable to extend the growing season despite available soil resources. Because of the low phenotypic variation, allocation to reproduction was similar across resource conditions. In contrast, the mesic population flowered later and showed a more opportunistic phenology in response to late-season water availability. The mesic population was not able to maintain consistent reproductive allocation at low resource levels. The responses of the two populations to late-season water availability were not affected by the density of neighboring plants. We suggest that post-introduction selection pressure on B. tectorum in the xeric habitat has resulted in a more fixed phenology which limits opportunistic response to unpredictable, particularly late-season resource availability. Opportunistic and fixed responses represent contrasting strategies for optimizing fitness in temporally varying environments and, while both play important roles for ensuring reproductive success, these results suggest that local adaptation to temporal resource variation may reflect a balance between flexible and inflexible phenology."

Questions: Do environmental features of recently invaded habitats shape population-level phenotypic variability? Are patterns of phenotypic variability suggestive of parallel adaptive divergence? And does the extent of phenotypic divergence increase as a function of distance between populations? Hypotheses: Populations that display similar phenotypes will inhabit similar environments. Patterns in morphology, coloration, and growth in an invasive stream-dwelling fish should be consistent with adaptation, and populations closer to each other should be more similar than should populations that are farther apart. Organism and study system: Sixteen brown trout populations of probable common descent, inhabiting a gradient of environments. These populations include the most ancestral (similar to 130 years old) and most recently established (similar to 20 years old). Analytical methods: We used multivariate statistical techniques to quantify morphological (e.g. body shape via geometric morphometrics and linear measurements of traits), meristic (e.g. counts of pigmentation spots), and growth traits from 1677 individuals. To account for ontogenetic and allometric effects on morphology, we conducted separate analyses on three distinct size/age classes. We used the BIO-ENV routine and Mantel tests to measure the correlation between phenotypic and habitat features. Results: Phenotypic similarity was significantly correlated with environmental similarity, especially in the larger size classes of fish. The extent to which these associations between phenotype and habitat result from parallel evolution, adaptive phenotypic plasticity, or historical founder effects is not known. Observed patterns of body shape and fin sizes were generally consistent with predictions of adaptive trait patterns, but other traits showed less consistent patterns with habitat features. Phenotypic differences increased as a function of straight-line distance (km) between watersheds and to a lesser extent fish dispersal distances, which suggests habitat has played a more significant role in shaping population phenotypes compared with founder effects. Conclusion: Recently established brown trout populations exhibit phenotype-by-environment correlations consistent with adaptation to newly encountered environments, a characteristic that may aid their spread to additional systems."

Pupfish body shape is correlated with environmental salinity: fish from saline habitats are characterized by slender body shapes, whereas fish from fresher, yet brackish springs are deep-bodied. In this study, lacustrine populations consisted of an approximately 30-year old population and several 1-year old populations, all introduced from the same source. The body shape divergence of the 30-year old population was significant and greater than any of the divergences of the 1-year old populations (which were for the most part not significant). Nonetheless, all body shape changes exhibited body deepening in less saline environments. We conclude that phenotypic plasticity potentially facilitates directional evolution of body deepening for introduced pupfish populations."

Taraxacum officinale (dandelion) is a perennial herb from Europe that has spread worldwide and can be found growing in a wide variety of habitats. We tested whether T. officinale plants from a heterogeneous environment in terms of water availability show greater phenotypic plasticity and better performance in response to experimental water shortage than plants from a less variable environment. This was tested at both low and moderate temperatures in plants from two sites (Corvallis, Oregon, USA, and El Blanco, Balmaceda, Chile) that differ in their pattern of monthly variation in rainfall during the growth season. We compared chlorophyll fluorescence (photosynthetic performance), flowering time, seed output, and total biomass. Plants subjected to drought showed delayed flowering and lower photosynthetic performance. Plants from USA, where rainfall variation during the growth season was greater, exhibited greater plasticity to water shortage in photosynthetic performance and flowering time than plants from Chile. This was true at both low and moderate temperatures, which were similar to early- and late-season conditions, respectively. However, phenotypic plasticity to decreased water availability was seemingly maladaptive because under both experimental temperatures USA plants consistently performed worse than Chile plants in the low water environment, showing lower total biomass and fewer seeds per flower head. We discuss the reliability of environmental clues for plasticity to be adaptive. Further research in the study species should include other plant traits involved in functional responses to drought or potentially associated with invasiveness."

Two non-exclusive factors have been suggested to promote this ability: adaptive phenotypic plasticity of individuals, and the evolution of locally adapted populations in the new range. We investigated these individual and population-level factors in Polygonum cespitosum, an Asian annual that has recently become invasive in northeastern North America. We characterized individual fitness, life-history, and functional plasticity in response to two contrasting glasshouse habitat treatments (full sun/dry soil and understory shade/moist soil) in 165 genotypes sampled from nine geographically separate populations representing the range of light and soil moisture conditions the species inhabits in this region. Polygonum cespitosum genotypes from these introduced-range populations expressed broadly similar plasticity patterns. In response to full sun, dry conditions, genotypes from all populations increased photosynthetic rate, water use efficiency, and allocation to root tissues, dramatically increasing reproductive fitness compared to phenotypes expressed in simulated understory shade. Although there were subtle among-population differences in mean trait values as well as in the slope of plastic responses, these population differences did not reflect local adaptation to environmental conditions measured at the population sites of origin. Instead, certain populations expressed higher fitness in both glasshouse habitat treatments. We also compared the introduced-range populations to a single population from the native Asian range, and found that the native population had delayed phenology, limited functional plasticity, and lower fitness in both experimental environments compared with the introduced-range populations. Our results indicate that the future spread of P. cespitosum in its introduced range will likely be fueled by populations consisting of individuals able to express high fitness across diverse light and moisture conditions, rather than by the evolution of locally specialized populations."

To test their importance in invasion success of Crofton weed, we examined the phenotypic response and genetic variation of the weed by conducting a field investigation, common garden experiments, and intersimple sequence repeat (ISSR) marker analysis on 16 populations in China. Molecular markers revealed low genetic variation among and within the sampled populations. There were significant differences in leaf area (LA), specific leaf area (SLA), and seed number (SN) among field populations, and plasticity index (Ply) for LA, SLA, and SN were 0.62, 0.46 and 0.85, respectively. Regression analyses revealed a significant quadratic effect of latitude of population origin on LA, SLA, and SN based on field data but not on traits in the common garden experiments (greenhouse and open air). Plants from different populations showed similar reaction norms across the two common gardens for functional traits. LA, SLA, aboveground biomass, plant height at harvest, first flowering day, and life span were higher in the greenhouse than in the open-air garden, whereas SN was lower. Growth conditions (greenhouse vs. open air) and the interactions between growth condition and population origin significantly affect plant traits. The combined evidence suggests high phenotypic plasticity but low genetically based variation for functional traits of Crofton weed in the invaded range. Therefore, we suggest that phenotypic plasticity is the primary strategy for Crofton weed as an aggressive invader that can adapt to diverse environments in China."

We tested this possibility in Australia using a continental scale survey of the invasive tree Parkinsonia aculeata (Fabaceae) in twenty-three sites distributed across four climate regions and three habitat types. Using tree-level responses, we detected a trade-off between seed mass and seed number across the moisture gradient. Individual trees plastically and reversibly produced many small seeds at dry sites or years, and few big seeds at wet sites and years. Bigger seeds were positively correlated with higher seed and seedling survival rates. The trade-off, the relation between seed mass, seed and seedling survival, and other fitness components of the plant life-cycle were integrated within a matrix population model. The model confirms that the plastic response resulted in average fitness benefits across the life-cycle. Plasticity resulted in average fitness being positively maintained at the wet and dry range margins where extinction risks would otherwise have been high (""Jack-of-all-Trades"" strategy JT), and fitness being maximized at the species range centre where extinction risks were already low (""Master-of-Some"" strategy MS). The resulting hybrid ""Jack-and-Master"" strategy (JM) broadened the geographic range and amplified average fitness in the range centre. Our study provides the first empirical evidence for a JM species. It also confirms mechanistically the importance of phenotypic plasticity in determining the size, the shape and the dynamic of a species distribution. The JM allows rapid and reversible phenotypic responses to new or changing moisture conditions at different scales, providing the species with definite advantages over genetic adaptation when invading diverse and variable environments. Furthermore, natural selection pressure acting on phenotypic plasticity is predicted to result in maintenance of the JT and strengthening of the MS, further enhancing the species invasiveness in its range centre."

The seedlings' ability to exploit different resource availabilities was examined in a two factorial experimental design of light and nutrient treatments by analysing 20 physiological and morphological traits. Competitiveness was tested using an additive experimental design in combination with N-15-labelling experiments. Light and nutrient availability had only minor effects on most physiological traits and differences between species were not significant. Plasticity in response to changes in resource availability occurred in morphological and allocation traits, revealing A. longifolia to be a species of intermediate responsiveness. The major competitive advantage of A. longifolia was its constitutively high shoot elongation rate at most resource treatments and its effective nutrient acquisition. Further, A. longifolia was found to be highly tolerant against competition from native species. In contrast to common expectations, the competition experiment indicated that A. longifolia expressed a constant allocation pattern and a phenotypic plasticity similar to that of the native species."

We investigated the phenotypic response of Chenopodium murale to resource variability and ontogeny. Its plant-level and leaf-level traits were studied at high-resource (HR) and low-resource (LR) sites in peri-urban areas in Indian dry tropics. Plants at LR had significantly higher root length, root/shoot biomass ratio, stem mass and root mass fractions. Plants at HR had higher shoot length, basal diameter, leaf mass fraction and leaf area ratio. Leaf-level traits like leaf area and chlorophyll a were also higher here. Mean plasticity indices for plant- and leaf-level traits were higher at HR. With increasing total plant biomass, there was significant increase in the biomass of leaf, stem, root, and reproductive parts, and root and shoot lengths, whereas root/shoot length ratio, their biomass ratio, and leaf and root mass fractions declined significantly. Allocation to roots and leaves significantly decreased with increasing plant size at both sites. But, at any size, allocation to roots was greater at LR, indicative of optimization of capture of soil nutrients, whereas leaf allocation was higher at HR. Consistently increasing stem allocation equaled leaf allocation at comparatively higher shoot lengths at HR. Reproductive biomass comprised 10-12% of the plant's total biomass. In conclusion, the success of alien weed C. murale across environmentally diverse habitat conditions in Indian dry tropics can be attributed to its high phenotypic plasticity, resource utilization capability in low-resource habitats and higher reproductive potential. These characteristics suggest that it will continue to be an aggressive invader."

Under high-nutrient conditions, introduced plants were taller and had more branches and greater aboveground biomass. They also exhibited significantly greater amounts of phenotypic plasticity for aboveground biomass than did the natives in response to changing nutrient levels in standing water. This difference in univariate plasticity contributed to the general contrast in multivariate plasticity between introduced and native plants. These results support the idea that introduced plants may successfully invade a habitat and grow better than native plants in response to increased resources."

Meanwhile, Phragmites australis Cav., a native salt marsh species on the east coast of China, has replaced the native S. alterniflora in many marshes along the Atlantic Coast of the US. This study determined the effects of nitrogen availability and culm density on the morphology, growth, and biomass allocation traits of Spartina alterniflora and Phragmites australis. A large number of morphological, growth, and biomass parameters were measured, and various derived values (culm: root ratio, specific leaf area, etc.) were calculated, along with an index of phenotypic plasticity. Nitrogen addition significantly affected growth performance and biomass allocation traits of Spartina alterniflora, and culm density significantly affected morphological characteristics in a negative way, especially for Spartina alterniflora. However, there were no significant interactions between nitrogen levels and culm density on the morphological parameters, growth performances parameters, and biomass allocation parameters of the two species. Spartina alterniflora appears to respond more strongly to nitrogen than to culm density and this pattern of phenotypic plasticity appears to offer an expedition for successful invasion and displacement of Phramites australias in China.

The invasion success of Ceratitis capitata probably stems from physiological, morphological, and behavioural adaptations that enable them to survive in different habitats. However, it is generally poorly understood if variation in acute thermal tolerance and its phenotypic plasticity might be important in facilitating survival of C. capitata upon introduction to novel environments. 2. Here, by comparison of widely distributed C. capitata with a narrowly distributed congener, C. rosa, we show that both species have similar levels of survival to acute high and low temperature exposures under common rearing conditions. However, these species differ dramatically in the time-course of plastic responses to acute low temperature treatments. 3. The range of temperatures that induce rapid cold hardening (RCH) are similar for both species. However, C. capitata has two distinct advantages over C. rosa. First, at 5 degrees C C. capitata develops RCH significantly faster than C. rosa. Second, C. capitata maintains a RCH response longer than C. rosa (8 vs. 0.5 h). 4. A simple population survival model, based on the estimated time-course of RCH responses determined for both species, was undertaken to simulate time to extinction for both species introduced into a similar thermally variable environment. The model showed that time to extinction is greater for C. capitata than for C. rosa, especially in habitats where temperatures frequently drop below 10 degrees C. 5. Thus, variation in RCH responses may translate into significant variation in survival upon introduction to novel thermal habitats for C. capitata, particularly in cooler and more thermally variable geographic regions, and may contribute to their ongoing invasion success relative to other, more geographically constrained Ceratitis species."

Pennisetum setaceum (fountain grass, Poaceae) is highly invasive in Hawaii (HI), moderately invasive in Arizona (AZ), and less invasive in southern California (CA). In common garden experiments, we examined the relative importance of quantitative trait variation, precipitation, and phenotypic plasticity in invasiveness. In two very different environments, plants showed no differences by state of origin (HI, CA, AZ) in aboveground biomass, seeds/flower, and total seed number. Plants from different states were also similar within watering treatment. Plants with supplemental watering, relative to unwatered plants, had greater biomass, specific leaf area (SLA), and total seed number, but did not differ in seeds/flower. Progeny grown from seeds produced under different watering treatments showed no maternal effects in seed mass, germination, biomass or SLA. High phenotypic plasticity, rather than local adaptation is likely responsible for variation in invasiveness. Global change models indicate that temperature and precipitation patterns over the next several decades will change, although the direction of change is uncertain. Drier summers in southern California may retard further invasion, while wetter summers may favor the spread of fountain grass."

Individuals in the newly introduced population exhibited increased growth and had higher mean reproductive investment than the two established populations across both study years. Individuals in the newest population also matured earlier than those in the older populations in 2009, but maturity schedules did not differ in 2010, possibly due to changes in environmental conditions causing life history shifts in both older populations. Overall, it appears that life history plasticity confers an important advantage to invasive species, allowing them to adapt for successful transitions throughout the invasion process, as well as to local conditions within the invaded system once they become fully integrated into established communities."

Plants of H. lanatus were collected from four geographic zones of southern Chile and established in a randomised complete block design with four replicates. Five newly emerging tillers were marked per plant and evaluated at the vegetative, pre-ear emergence, complete emerged in florescence, end of flowering period, and mature seed stages. At each evaluation, one marked tiller was harvested per plant. The variables measured included lamina length and width, tiller height, length of the in florescence, total number of leaves, and leaf, stem, and in florescence mass. At each phenological stage, groups of accessions were statistically formed using cluster analysis. The grouping of accessions (cluster analysis) into statistically different groups (ANOVA and canonical variate analysis) indicated the existence of different ecotypes. The phenotypic variation within each group of the accessions suggested that each group has its own phenotypic plasticity. It is concluded that the successful colonisation by H. lanatus has resulted from diversity within the species."

Its status as invasive alien species is now widely recognised. Theory suggests that invasive populations should evolve toward greater phenotypic plasticity because they encounter differing environments during the invasion process. On the contrary, populations used for biological control have been maintained under artificial rearing conditions for many generations; they are hence expected to become specialised on a narrow range of environments and show lower phenotypic plasticity. Here we compared phenotypic traits and the extent of adaptive phenotypic plasticity in two invasive populations and two populations commercialized for biological control by (i) measuring six phenotypic traits related to fitness (eggs hatching rate, larval survival rate, development time, sex ratio, fecundity over 6 weeks and survival time of starving adults) at three temperatures (18, 24 and 30 degrees C), (ii) recording the survival rate and quiescence aggregation behaviour when exposed to low temperatures (5, 10 and 15 degrees C), and (iii) studying the cannibalistic behaviour of populations in the absence of food. Invasive and biocontrol populations displayed significantly different responses to temperature variation for a composite fitness index computed from the traits measured at 18, 24 and 30 degrees C, but not for any of those traits considered independently. The plasticity measured on the same fitness index was higher in the two invasive populations, but this difference was not statistically significant. On the other hand, invasive populations displayed significantly higher survival and higher phenotypic plasticity when entering into quiescence at low temperatures. In addition, one invasive population displayed a singular cannibalistic behaviour. Our results hence only partly support the expectation of increased adaptive phenotypic plasticity of European invasive populations of H. axyridis, and stress the importance of the choice of the environmental parameters to be manipulated for assessing phenotypic plasticity variation among populations."

The successful introduction and invasive potential of a species are related to its levels of phenotypic plasticity and genetic polymorphism. We analysed changes in the body mass and length of American mink (Neovison vison) since its introduction into the Warta Mouth National Park, western Poland, in relation to diet composition and colonization progress from 1996 to 2004. Mink body mass decreased significantly during the period of population establishment within the study area, with an average decrease of 13% from 1.36 to 1.18 kg in males and of 16% from 0.83 to 0.70 kg in females. Diet composition varied seasonally and between consecutive years. The main prey items were mammals and fish in the cold season and birds and fish in the warm season. During the study period the proportion of mammals preyed upon increased in the cold season and decreased in the warm season. The proportion of birds preyed upon decreased over the study period, whereas the proportion of fish increased. Following introduction, the strictly aquatic portion of mink diet (fish and frogs) increased over time, whereas the proportion of large prey (large birds, muskrats, and water voles) decreased. The average yearly proportion of large prey and average-sized prey in the mink diet was significantly correlated with the mean body masses of males and females. Biogeographical variation in the body mass and length of mink was best explained by the percentage of large prey in the mink diet in both sexes, and by latitude for females. Together these results demonstrate that American mink rapidly changed their body mass in relation to local conditions. This phenotypic variability may be underpinned by phenotypic plasticity and/or by adaptation of quantitative genetic variation. The potential to rapidly change phenotypic variation in this manner is an important factor determining the negative ecological impacts of invasive species.

Such increases are associated with reduced biodiversity, altered fire regimes, and a more intense competitive environment for commercially important species. We measured rates of clonal spread by I. cylindrica from a roadside edge into the interior of two longleaf pine savannas. In addition, we measured the effects of fertilization with nitrogen and phosphorus on clonal invasion of one of these sites. Clonal invasion occurred at both sites and at similar rates. Older portions of an I. cylindrica sward contained fewer species of native pine-savanna plants. Clonal growth rates and aboveground mass of I. cylindrica were reduced by the addition of phosphorus relative to controls by the second growing season at one site. As a group, native species were not affected much by P-addition, although the height of legumes was increased by P addition, and the percent cover of legumes relative to native non-legumes decreased with increasing expected P limitation (i.e., going from P-fertilized to controls to N-fertilized treatments). Clonal invasion was negatively correlated with the relative abundance of legumes in control plots but not in P-fertilized plots. Species richness and percent cover of native plants ( both legumes and non-legumes) were dramatically lower in N-fertilized plots than in controls or P-fertilized plots. Species richness of native plants was negatively correlated with final aboveground mass of I. cylindrica in control and P-fertilized plots, but not in N-fertilized plots. The results suggest that I. cylindrica is a better competitor for phosphorus than are native pine-savanna plants, especially legumes, and that short-lived, high-level pulses of phosphorus addition reduce this competitive advantage without negatively affecting native plant diversity. Ratios of soil P to N or native legume to non-legume plant species may provide indicators of the resistance of pristine pine savannas to clonal invasion by I. cylindrica."

We examined the invasive strategy of Berberis darwinii in New Zealand compared with four co-occurring native species by examining germination, seedling survival, photosynthetic characteristics and water-use efficiency of adult plants, in sun and shade environments. Berberis darwinii seeds germinated more in shady sites than the other natives, but survival was low. In contrast, while germination of B. darwinii was the same as the native species in sunny sites, seedling survival after 18 months was nearly twice that of the all native species. The maximum photosynthetic rate of B. darwinii was nearly double that of all native species in the sun, but was similar among all species in the shade. Other photosynthetic traits (quantum yield and stomatal conductance) did not generally differ between B. darwinii and the native species, regardless of light environment. Berberis darwinii had more positive values of delta C-13 than the four native species, suggesting that it gains more carbon per unit water transpired than the competing native species. These results suggest that the invasion success of B. darwinii may be partially explained by combination of a Jack-of-all-trades scenario of widespread germination with a master-of-some scenario through its ability to photosynthesize at higher rates in the sun and, hence, gain a rapid height and biomass advantage over native species in favourable environments."

Such damage may be more likely for exotics with close native relatives in the invaded area, since shifts of enemies should be more likely among closely related hosts. In this study, we evaluated whether exotics experience less herbivore damage than natives, and whether phylogenetically novel exotics experience less damage that those that are more closely related to locally occurring family members. Foliar damage was measured on 20 native and 15 exotic Asteraceae that co-occur locally in southern Ontario, Canada. The phylogenetic structure of this damage was quantified using an eigenvector decomposition method, and the relationship between damage and phylogenetic novelty of exotics was evaluated based on phylogenetic distances to other locally occurring Asteraceae. Our results show that 32% of the variation in damage was explained by phylogenetic relationship; similarity in damage tended to be associated with tribes. As predicted, exotics experienced lower damage than native species, even when the dataset was corrected for phylogenetic nonindependence. Contrary to our prediction, however, exotics that were more phylogenetically isolated from locally occurring relatives did not experience less damage. These results suggest that, though exotic Asteraceae may escape many of their natural enemies, this is not in general more likely for species phylogenetically distant from locally occurring native confamilials."

When species were grouped as invasive (two species), noninvasive (five species), and native (six species), no differences were found for the suite of traits examined, likely because of the high variability within and between groups. However, when exotic species, regardless of invasiveness, were compared with the native species, specific leaf area was ca. 40% higher for the exotic species, a result that is consistent with that of other studies. This pattern was also observed for five of seven pairwise comparisons of exotic and native species with similar life history traits. In contrast, total end-of-season biomass was as much as three times higher for the native species in five of seven of the native-exotic species pairs. For other traits, differences between exotic and native species were species-specific and were generally more numerous for noninvasive than for invasive exotic species pair-wise comparisons. Thus, contrary to predictions, exotic species capable of successfully invading tallgrass prairie did not differ considerably from native species in most traits related to resource utilization and carbon gain. Moreover, invasive exotic species, those capable of displacing native species and dominating a community, were not distinct for the observed traits from their native counterparts. These results indicate that other traits, such as the ability to respond to resource pulses or herbivory, may explain more effectively why certain invasive species are able to invade these communities aggressively."

Phytophagous insects were collected in the native range of the giant hogweed (Caucasus) and were compared to those found oil plants in the invaded parts of Europe. The list of herbivores was compiled from surveys of 27 localities in nine countries during two seasons. In addition, literature records for herbivores were analysed for a total of 16 Heracleum species. We recorded a total of 265 herbivorous insects on Heracleum species and we analysed them to describe the herbivore assemblages, locate vacant niches, and identify the most host-specific herbivores oil H. mantegazzianum. When combining our investigations with similar studies of herbivores on other invasive weeds, all studies show a higher proportion of specialist herbivores in the native habitats compared to the invaded areas, supporting the ""enemy release hypothesis"" (ERH). When analysing the relative size of the niches (measured as plant organ biomass), we found less herbivore species per biomass oil the stem and roots, and more on the leaves (Fig. 5). Most herbivores were polyphagous generalists, some were found to be oligophagous (feeding within the same family of host plants) and a few had only Heracleum species as host plants (monophagous). None were known to feed exclusively oil H. mantegazzianum. The oligophagous herbivores were restricted to a few taxonomic groups, especially within the Hemiptera, and were particularly abundant oil this weed."

Pairs of 4-ha sites were selected for sampling: in each pair of sites, one was root plowed in 1965 and another was not disturbed by roof plowing (untreated). We estimated canopy cover of woody and herbaceous vegetation during summer 2003 and canopy cover of herbaceous vegetation during spring 2004. We trapped small mammals and herpetofauna in pitfall traps during late spring and summer 2001-2004. Species diversity and richness of woody plants were less on root-plowed than on untreated sites; however, herbaceous plant and animal species did not differ greatly between treatments. Evenness of woody vegetation was less on root-plowed sites, in part because woody legumes were more abundant. Abundance of small mammals and herpetofauna varied with annual rainfall more than it varied with root plowing. Although structural differences existed between vegetation communities, secondary succession of vegetation reestablishing after root plowing appears to be leading to convergence in plant and small animal species composition with untreated sites."

We simulated encroachment by planting J. virginiana seedlings in tallgrass prairie, old-field grassland, and upland oak forest. We used J. virginiana survival and growth as an index of encroachment success and evaluated success as a function of plant community traits (i.e., species richness, species diversity, and species composition). Our results indicated that J. virginiana encroachment success increased with increasing plant richness and diversity. Moreover, growth and survival of J. virginiana seedlings was associated with plant species composition only in the old-field grassland and upland oak forest.

The first step to disentangling the direction of causality is to discern whether a relationship with other vegetation exists at all. Carduus nutans and C. acanthoides are similar invasive thistles, which have caused substantial economic damage worldwide. We assessed the associations between the thistles and the standing flora in four sites in central Pennsylvania in which they co-occur. After sampling nearly 2000 plots of 1 m(2), we used partial Mantel tests to assess the differences in vegetation between thistle and non-thistle plots after accounting for location, and non-metric multidimensional scaling to visualize differences among plots and sites. We found significant differences in community composition in plots with and without Carduus thistles. The non-native species Sisymbrium officinale and Coronilla varia were consistently associated with the presence of Carduus thistles. Several species were associated with areas that were free of Carduus thistles, including an important non-native pasture species (Trifolium repens). We found no evidence for differences in composition between plots with C. nutans versus C. acanthoides, suggesting that they have similar associations with the vegetation community. We conclude that even at the within-field scale, areas invaded by Carduus thistles have different vegetation associations than uninvaded areas, allowing us to target future research about the role of vegetation structure in resisting and responding to invasion."

Observational studies of plant invasions, however, find little support for this hypothesis and argue strongly against it. Lack of control of extrinsic factors (e.g., disturbance. climate, or soil fertility) that covary with biodiversity and invasion in observational studies makes it difficult to determine if their findings truly refute Elton's hypothesis. We examined performance of Crepis tectorum (an invasive, annual composite weed) in experimental prairie grassland plots and greenhouse plant assemblages in which resident species richness was directly manipulated. Under these conditions, unlike observational studies, no covarying extrinsic factors could interfere with interpreting results. We found a strong inverse association between resident diversity and invader performance as predicted by Elton's hypothesis. Higher resident diversity increased crowding, decreased available light, and decreased available nutrients all of which increased the competitive environment of diverse plant assemblages and reduced C. tectorum success. Examination of individual resident species impacts on C. tectorum performance demonstrated that this diversity effect was not due to the sampling effect. These results suggest that both Elton's hypothesis and its competitive mechanism may operate in nature, but covarying extrinsic factors may obscure the negative impact of diversity on invader success."

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships between plant diversity, herbivory and performance of two annual exotics, Conyza bonariensis and C. canadensis, in Mediterranean annual communities. We wanted to test whether herbivory of these exotics was influenced either by species richness, functional-group richness or functional-group composition. We also studied the relationship between herbivory on the exotic species and their performance. Herbivory increased with increasing species and functional-group richness for both Conyza species. These patterns are interpreted as reflecting a greater number of available herbivore niches in a richer, more complex, plant community. The identities of functional groups also affected Conyza herbivory, which decreased in the presence of Asteraceae or Fabaceae and increased in the presence of Poaceae. Increasing herbivory had consequences for vegetative and demographic parameters of both invasive species: survival, final biomass and net fecundity decreased with increasing herbivory, leading to a loss of reproductive capacity. We conclude that communities characterised by a high number of grass species instead of Asteraceae or Fabaceae may be more resistant to invasion by the two Conyza species, in part due to predation by native herbivores."

Less than 1% of such introductions have been solely accidental. Plant introductions also occur within Australia, as exotic and native species are moved across the country. Plant-based industries contribute around $50 billion to Australia’s economy each year, play a signifi cant social role and can also provide environmental benefi ts such as mitigating dryland salinity. However, one of the downsides of a new plant introduction is the potential to become a new weed. Overall, 10% of exotic plant species introduced since European settlement have naturalised, but this rate is higher for agricultural and forestry plants. Exotic plant species have become agricultural, noxious and natural ecosystem weeds at rates of 4%, 1% and 7% respectively. Whilst garden plants have the lowest probability of becoming weeds this is more than compensated by their vast numbers of introductions, such that gardening is the greatest source of weeds in Australia. Resolving confl icts of interest with plant introductions needs a collaborative effort between those stakeholders who would benefi t (i.e. grow the plant) and those who would potentially lose (i.e. gain a weed) to compare the weed risk, feasibility of management and benefi ts of the species in question. For proposed plant imports to Australia, weed risk is presently the single consideration under international trade rules. Hence the focus is on ensuring the optimal performance of the border Weed Risk Assessment System. For plant species already present in Australia there are inconsistencies in managing weed risk between the States/Territories. This is being addressed with the development of a national standard for weed risk management. For agricultural and forestry species of high economic value but signifi cant weed risk, the feasibility of standard risk management approaches needs to be investigated. Invasive garden plants need national action."

Along altitudinal gradients, factors such as propagule pressure, climatic conditions and biotic interactions change simultaneously across rather small geographic scales. Here we investigate the distribution of eight Asteraceae forbs along mountain roads in both their native and introduced ranges in the Valais (southern Swiss Alps) and the Wallowa Mountains (northeastern Oregon, USA). We hypothesised that a lack of adaptation and more limiting propagule pressure at higher altitudes in the new range restricts the altitudinal distribution of aliens relative to the native range. However, all but one of the species reached the same or even a higher altitude in the new range. Thus neither the need to adapt to changing climatic conditions nor lower propagule pressure at higher altitudes appears to have prevented the altitudinal spread of introduced populations. We found clear differences between regions in the relative occurrence of alien species in ruderal sites compared to roadsides, and in the degree of invasion away from the roadside, presumably reflecting differences in disturbance patterns between regions. Whilst the upper altitudinal limits of these plant invasions are apparently climatically constrained, factors such as anthropogenic disturbance and competition with native vegetation appear to have greater influence than changing climatic conditions on the distribution of these alien species along altitudinal gradients."

We analysed the newly compiled list of casual and naturalized plant species in Taiwan (probably the only complete data set of this kind in East Asia) and found that Taiwan is relatively lightly invaded with only 8% of the flora being casual or naturalized. Moreover, the index of casual and naturalized species per log area is also moderate, in striking contrast with many other island floras where contributions of naturalized species are much higher. Casual and naturalized species have accumulated steadily and almost linearly over the past decades. Fabaceae, Asteraceae, and Poaceae are the families with the most species. However, Amaranthaceae, Convolvulaceae, and Onagraceae have the largest ratios of casual and naturalized species to their global numbers. Ipomoea, Solanum and Crotalaria have the highest numbers of casual and naturalized species. About 60% of all genera with exotic species are new to Taiwan. Perennial herbs represent one third of the casual and naturalized flora, followed by annual herbs. About 60% of exotic species were probably introduced unintentionally onto the island; many species imported intentionally have ornamental, medicinal, or forage values. The field status of 50% of these species is unknown, but ornamentals represent noticeable proportions of naturalized species, while forage species represent a relatively larger proportion of casual species. Species introduced for medicinal purposes seem to be less invasive. Most of the casual and naturalized species of Taiwan originated from the Tropical Americas, followed by Asia and Europe."

We conducted an experiment designed to determine the relative importance of plants and honeydew-producing insects feeding on plants to the growth of colonies of the invasive ant Solenopsis invicta (Buren). We found that colonies of S. invicta grew substantially when they only had access to unlimited insect prey; however, colonies that also had access to plants colonized by honeydew-producing Hemiptera grew significantly and substantially (approximate to 50%) larger. Our experiment also showed that S. invicta was unable to acquire significant nutritional resources directly from the Hemiptera host plant but acquired them indirectly from honeydew. Honeydew alone is unlikely to be sufficient for colony growth, however, and both carbohydrates abundant in plants and proteins abundant in animals are likely to be necessary for optimal growth, Our experiment provides important insight into the effects-of a common tritrophic interaction among an invasive mealybug, Antonina graminis (Maskell), an invasive host grass, Cynodon dactylon L. Pers., and S. invicta in the southeastern United States, suggesting that interactions among these species can be important in promoting extremely high population densities of S. invicta."

Though this phenomenon is well documented, scientists seem to be drawn to opposing views when it comes to explaining the high ratio of alien to native plants. Several ecological concepts claim that in cities. alien species displace native species. However, several studies show that both species groups increase proportionally. Another view tries to Correlate the high species number in urban areas to the heterogeneity of the urban landscape. This correlation seems to be evident but still needs to be tested. Most of these findings stem from studies performed on large or intermediate scales using data from official databases. We wanted to confront existing findings and opinions with our study comparing a typical urban with an agricultural landscape section on a local scale. Our results support the view that plant species richness is higher in cities than in surrounding rural areas, partly because of a high rate of alien species brought into cities by humans. However, this species richness stems from an increase in alien as well as native species. Higher species richness is supported by a highly varying landscape structure mainly caused by anthropogenic land use.(c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

We found no evidence of a latitudinal gradient for the density of native plant species and a significant, slightly positive latitudinal gradient for the density of nonnative plant species. We found stronger evidence of a significant, positive productivity gradient (vegetation carbon) for the density of native plant species and nonnative plant species. We found much stronger significant relationships when biotic, environmental/topographic, and human variables were used to predict native plant species density and nonnative plant species density. Biotic variables generally had far greater influence in multivariate models than human or environmental/topographic variables. Later, we found that the best, single, positive predictor of the density of nonnative plant species in a county was the density of native plant species in a county. While further study is needed, it may be that, while humans facilitate the initial establishment invasions of nonnative plant species, the spread and subsequent distributions of nonnative species are controlled largely by biotic and environmental factors."

Moreover, those Hemiptera may themselves often be introduced or invasive. To test the importance of mutualisms for invasive species, we conducted a study in the southeastern United States of factors hypothesized to affect the abundance of an invasive ant native to South America, Solenopsis invicta. The study was conducted within grazing pastures, where S. invicta can be extremely abundant while also exhibiting substantial variability in abundance. A path analysis showed that the abundance of S. invicta was strongly and positively affected by the abundance of an invasive honeydew-producing mealybug native to Asia, Antonina graminis, and by the mealybugs' host grasses because of their strong positive effect on mealybug abundance. Abundance of the mealybug was primarily attributable to an invasive host grass native to Africa, Cynodon dactylon. The abundance of S. invicta was also positively affected by the abundance of other arthropods that they are likely to consume, and those arthropods were positively affected by the abundance of both the A. graminis host grasses and other plants. Thus the study shows that the distribution and abundance of different plant species could have important effects on the abundance of S. invicta through their effect on the ants' food resources. The results are also consistent with the hypothesis that the emergence of novel trophic interactions among invasive species can promote the abundance of invasive ants."

Here we present evidence showing that the invasion of black cherry (Prunus serotina) into north-western Europe is facilitated by the soil community. In the native range in the USA, the soil community that develops near black cherry inhibits the establishment of neighbouring conspecifics and reduces seedling performance in the greenhouse. In contrast, in the non-native range, black cherry readily establishes in close proximity to conspecifics, and the soil community enhances the growth of its seedlings. Understanding the effects of soil organisms on plant abundance will improve our ability to predict and counteract plant invasions."

However, rigorous investigations of this idea using cross-continental comparisons, including native and invasive plant populations, are still scarce. We investigated if interactions with the soil community affect the growth and biomass allocation of the (sub)tropical invasive shrub Chromolaena odorata. We performed a cross-continental comparison with both native and non-native-range soil and native and non-native-range plant populations in two glasshouse experiments. Results are interpreted in the light of three prominent hypotheses that explain the dominance of invasive plants in the non-native range: the enemy release hypothesis, the evolution of increased competitive ability hypothesis and the accumulation of local pathogens hypothesis. Our results show that C. odorata performed significantly better when grown in soil pre-cultured by a plant species other than C. odorata. Soil communities from the native and non-native ranges did not differ in their effect on C. odorata performance. However, soil origin had a significant effect on plant allocation responses. Non-native C. odorata plants increased relative allocation to stem biomass and height growth when confronted with soil communities from the non-native range. This is a plastic response that may allow species to be more successful when competing for light. This response differed between native and non-native-range populations, suggesting that selection may have taken place during the process of invasion. Whether this plastic response to soil organisms will indeed select for increased competitive ability needs further study. The native grass Panicum maximum did not perform worse when grown in soil pre-cultured by C. odorata. Therefore, our results did not support the accumulation of local pathogens hypothesis. Synthesis. Non-native C. odorata did not show release from soil-borne enemies compared to its native range. However, non-native plants responded to soil biota from the non-native range by enhanced allocation in stem biomass and height growth. This response can affect the competitive balance between native and invasive species. The evolutionary potential of this soil biota-induced change in plant biomass allocation needs further study."

The study was conducted on 202 experimental plots in Rogow Arboretum (Central Poland), consisting of plantations of alien and native tree species, growing on potential habitats of fertile deciduous forest. The density of natural regeneration was measured in four height classes: 0-0.5 m, 0.5-2 m, 2-5 m and over 5 m. Natural regeneration of black cherry occurred on 79 of the 202 plots, and its density varied from 0 to 25,660 ind. ha A1. The mean density of black cherry was statistically significantly higher (p < 0.001) in coniferous (1275.8 +- 374.2 ind. ha A1) than in deciduous (138.3 +- 48.3 ind. ha A1) and mixed (29.3 +- 12.3 ind. ha A1) stands.

Indicators of propagule pressure (number of administrative units in which a species is planted and total planting area) and time of introduction into cultivation were used as explanatory variables in multiple regression models. Fourteen species escaped from cultivation, and 39% of the variance was explained by the number of planting units and the time of introduction, the latter being more important. Species introduced early bad a higher probability of escape than those introduced later, with more than 95% probability of escape for those introduced before 1801 and < 5% for those introduced after 1892. Probability of naturalization was more difficult to predict, and eight species were misclassified. A model omitting two species with the largest influence on the model yielded similar predictors of naturalization as did the probability of escape. Both phases of invasion therefore appear to be driven by Planting and introduction history in a similar way. Our results demonstrate the importance of forestry for recruitment of invasive trees. Six alien forestry trees, classified as invasive in the Czech Republic, are currently reported in nature reserves. In addition, forestry authorities want to increase the diversity of alien species and planting area in the country."
"Planting intensity, residence time, and species traits determine invasion success of alien woody species/Contribution 1","Observational or correlational","North America","Propagule pressure","Supported",109,"Field","Testing the propagule pressure hypothesis in invasion biology",2009,"Planting intensity, residence time, and species traits determine invasion success of alien woody species/Contribution 1","Planting intensity, residence time, and species traits determine invasion success of alien woody species","Terrestrial","Plants",NA,NA,"Establishment",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Other proxies",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Planting intensity, residence time, and species traits determine invasion success of alien woody species","10.1890/08-0857.1","We studied the relative importance of residence time, propagule pressure, and species traits in three stages of invasion of alien woody plants cultivated for about 150 years in the Czech Republic, Central Europe. The probability of escape from cultivation, naturalization, and invasion was assessed using classification trees. We compared 109 escaped-not-escaped congeneric pairs, 44 naturalized-not-naturalized, and 17 invasive-not-invasive congeneric pairs. We used the following predictors of the above probabilities: date of introduction to the target region as a measure of residence time; intensity of planting in the target area as a proxy for propagule pressure; the area of origin; and 21 species-specific biological and ecological traits. The misclassification rates of the naturalization and invasion model were low, at 19.3% and 11.8%, respectively, indicating that the variables used included the major determinants of these processes. The probability of escape increased with residence time in the Czech Republic, whereas the probability of naturalization increased with the residence time in Europe. This indicates that some species were already adapted to local conditions when introduced to the Czech Republic. Apart from residence time, the probability of escape depends on planting intensity (propagule pressure), and that of naturalization on the area of origin and fruit size; it is lower for species from Asia and those with small fruits. The probability of invasion is determined by a long residence time and the ability to tolerate low temperatures. These results indicate that a simple suite of factors determines, with a high probability, the invasion success of alien woody plants, and that the relative role of biological traits and other factors is stage dependent. High levels of propagule pressure as a result of planting lead to woody species eventually escaping from cultivation, regardless of biological traits. However, the biological traits play a role in later stages of invasion."

Altered disturbance regimes are thought to favour invasive species that have a high phenotypic plasticity, although most studies measure plasticity under controlled conditions in the greenhouse and then assume plasticity is an advantage in the field. Here, we compare trait plasticity between three co-occurring, C(4) perennial grass species, an invader Eragrostis curvula, and natives Eragrostis sororia and Aristida personata to grazing and fertilizer in a three-year field trial. We measured abundances and several leaf traits known to correlate with strategies used by plants to fix carbon and acquire resources, i.e. specific leaf area (SLA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), leaf nutrient concentrations (N, C:N, P), assimilation rates (Amax) and photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency (PNUE). In the control treatment (grazed only), trait values for SLA, leaf C:N ratios, Amax and PNUE differed significantly between the three grass species. When trait values were compared across treatments, E. curvula showed higher trait plasticity than the native grasses, and this correlated with an increase in abundance across all but the grazed/fertilized treatment. The native grasses showed little trait plasticity in response to the treatments. Aristida personata decreased significantly in the treatments where E. curvula increased, and E. sororia abundance increased possibly due to increased rainfall and not in response to treatments or invader abundance. Overall, we found that plasticity did not favour an increase in abundance of E. curvula under the grazed/fertilized treatment likely because leaf nutrient contents increased and subsequently its' palatability to consumers. E. curvula also displayed a higher resource use efficiency than the native grasses. These findings suggest resource conditions and disturbance regimes can be manipulated to disadvantage the success of even plastic exotic species."

To test the first hypothesis, we conducted a greenhouse pot experiment in which seedlings of invasive Sapium sebiferum competed against native Schizachyrium scoparium grasses under different light and water conditions. To test the second hypothesis. we performed an additional greenhouse pot experiment in which seedlings from native and invasive populations of S. sebiferum were grown Under environmental treatments analogous to those ill the first greenhouse experiment. Compared to native S. scoparium grasses. or to S. sebiferum seedlings from native populations.,growth rates of S. sebiferum seedlings from invasive populations were generally higher. When they were competing with S. scoparium grasses. the greater response of S. sebiferum to light and water conditions reflected different patterns: S. sebiferum seedlines were better able to respond with increased growth in unflooded soils. whereas S. sebiferum had more robust growth in the shaded conditions. No difference in responses to Change in water conditions. but a significant difference in responses to variation in light conditions was found between two population types Of S. sebiferum. The results Of this Study suggest that relative to S. scoparium, the greater Plasticity of S. sebiferum to variation in light conditions is evolved in the introduced range, while that to variation in water conditions reflects an innate property.

As a result of interspecific interactions such as pollination, the decline, loss, or introduction of species can have cascading effects on island ecosystems. We studied Hylaeus spp., Hawai'i's yellow-faced bees, the only native bees in Hawai'i. This group of potentially important pollinators has been largely overlooked until recently, and its conservation status and ecological role are virtually unknown. We investigated how native ( Hylaeus spp.) and nonnative (Apis mellifera) bees interact with flowering plants in a large-scale pasture-to-forest restoration system. We used pan traps and nets to collect bees in mature forest, remnant corridors, planted Acacia koa tracts, and open pastureland. We removed pollen from each specimen and identified it using pollen samples collected on-site. We found that Hylaeus spp. were more likely to carry less pollen and more likely to exhibit higher pollinator fidelity compared with A. mellifera. By contrast, A. mellifera was more likely to carry mixed pollen and forage on invasive plant species. This is the first investigation in Hawai'i to compare patterns of pollen carriage between native and nonnative bees and the first study to document pollen carried by Hylaeus spp. in the context of forest restoration."

The ERH is popularly cited to explain the invasive properties of many species and is the underpinning of biological control. We tested the prediction that plant populations are more strongly regulated by natural enemies (herbivores and pathogens) in their native range than in their introduced range with enemy-removal experiments using pesticides. These experiments were replicated at multiple sites in both the native and invaded ranges of the grass Brachypodium sylvaticum. In support of the ERH, enemies consistently regulated populations in the native range. There were more tillers and more seeds produced in treated vs. untreated plots in the native range, and few seedlings survived in the native range. Contrary to the ERH, total measured leaf damage was similar in both ranges, though the enemies that caused it differed. There was more damage by generalist mollusks and pathogens in the native range, and more damage by generalist insect herbivores in the invaded range.

We tested the prediction that plant populations are more strongly regulated by natural enemies (herbivores and pathogens) in their native range than in their introduced range with enemy-removal experiments using pesticides. These experiments were replicated at multiple sites in both the native and invaded ranges of the grass Brachypodium sylvaticum. In support of the ERH, enemies consistently regulated populations in the native range. There were more tillers and more seeds produced in treated vs. untreated plots in the native range, and few seedlings survived in the native range. Contrary to the ERH, total measured leaf damage was similar in both ranges, though the enemies that caused it differed.

Many of the small-scale studies are conducted in artificial communities of even-aged plants. Species in natural communities, however, do not represent one simultaneous cohort and occur at various levels of spatial aggregation at different scales. This study used natural patterns of diversity to assess the relationship between diversity and invasibility within a uniformly managed, semi-natural community. Methods In species-rich grassland, one seed of each of ten species was added to each of 50 contiguous 16 cm(2) quadrats within seven plots (8 x 100 cm). The emergence of these species was recorded in seven control plots, and establishment success was measured in relation to the species diversity of the resident vegetation at two spatial scales, quadrat (64 cm(2)) within plots (800 cm(2)) and between plots within the site (approx. 400 m(2)) over 46 months. Key Results Invader success was positively related to resident species diversity and richness over a range of 28-37 species per plot. This relationship emerged 7 months after seed addition and remained over time despite continuous mortality of invaders. Conclusions Biotic resistance to plant invasion may play only a sub-ordinate role in species-rich, semi-natural grassland. As possible alternative explanations for the positive diversity-invasibility relationship are not clear, it is recommended that future studies elaborate fine-scale environmental heterogeneity in resource supplies or potential resource flows from resident species to seedlings by means of soil biological networks established by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi."

Facilitation between invaders may lead to an overall acceleration in invasion success and impacts. Mechanisms of facilitation include habitat alteration, or ecosystem engineering, and trophic interactions. In marine systems, only a handful of positive effects have been reported for invading species. In an unusual NE Pacific marine assemblage dominated by 5 conspicuous invaders and 2 native species, we identified positive effects of the most abundant invader, the Asian hornsnail Batillaria attramentaria, on all other species. B. attramentaria reached densities > 1400 m(-2), providing an average of 600 cm of hard substrate per m(2) on this mudflat, Its shells were used as habitat almost exclusively by the introduced Atlantic slipper shell Crepidula convexa, the introduced Asian anemone Diadumene lineata, and 2 native hermit crabs Pagurus hirsutiusculus and P. granosimanus. In addition, manipulative experiments showed that the abundance of the mudsnail Nassarius fraterculus and percentage cover of the eelgrass Zostera japonica, both introduced from the NW Pacific, increased significantly in the presence of B. attramentaria. The most likely mechanisms for these facilitations are indirect grazing effects and bioturbation, respectively. Since the precise arrival dates of all these invaders are unknown, the role of B. attramentaria's positive interactions in their initial invasion success is unknown, Nevertheless, by providing habitat for 2 non-native epibionts and 2 native species, and by facilitating 2 other invaders, the non-native B. attramentaria enhances the level of invasion by all 6 species."

However, pollinator service of less attractive species could be enhanced when they are associated with species with highly attractive flowers (so called 'magnet-species'). Although several studies have reported the magnet species effect, few of them have evaluated whether this positive interaction result in an enhancement of the seed output for the beneficiary species. Here, we compared pollinator visitation rates and seed output of the invasive annual species Carduus pycnocephalus when grow associated with shrubs of the invasive Lupinus arboreus and when grow alone, and hypothesized that L. arboreus acts as a magnet species for C. pycnocephalus. Results showed that C. pycnocephalus individuals associated with L. arboreus had higher pollinator visitation rates and higher seed output than individuals growing alone. The higher visitation rates of C. pycnocephalus associated to L. arboreus were maintained after accounting for flower density, which consistently supports our hypothesis on the magnet species effect of L. arboreus. Given that both species are invasives, the facilitated pollination and reproduction of C. pycnocephalus by L. arboreus could promote its naturalization in the community, suggesting a synergistic invasional process contributing to an 'invasional meltdown'. The magnet effect of Lupinus on Carduus found in this study seems to be one the first examples of indirect facilitative interactions via increased pollination among invasive species."

We recorded woody sapling recruitment and micro-environmental conditions under the canopies of Pyracantha and the dominant native shrub Condalia montana (Rhamnaceae), and in the absence of shrub cover, considering these situations as three treatments. We found that native and exotic species richness were higher under Pyracantha than under the other treatments. Ligustrum lucidum (Oleaceae), an exotic bird-dispersed shade-tolerant tree, was the most abundant species recruiting in the area, and its density was four times higher under the canopy of Pyracantha. This positive interaction may be related to Pyracantha's denser shading, to the mechanical protection of its canopy against ungulates, and/or to the simultaneous fruit ripening of both woody invaders."

We investigated facilitation at an earlier stage in the invasion process: during entrainment of propagules in a transport pathway. The introduced bryozoan Watersipora subtorquata is tolerant of several antifouling biocides and a common component of hull-fouling assemblages, a major transport pathway for aquatic NIS. We predicted that colonies of W. subtorquata act as nontoxic refugia for other, less tolerant species to settle on. We compared rates of recruitment of W. subtorquata and other fouling organisms to surfaces coated with three antifouling paints and a nontoxic primer in coastal marinas in Queensland, Australia. Diversity and abundance of fouling taxa were compared between bryozoan colonies and adjacent toxic or nontoxic paint surfaces. After 16 weeks immersion, W. subtorquata covered up to 64% of the tile surfaces coated in antifouling paint. Twenty-two taxa occurred exclusively on W. subtorquata and were not found on toxic surfaces. Other fouling taxa present on toxic surfaces were up to 248 times more abundant on W. subtorquata. Because biocides leach from the paint surface, we expected a positive relationship between the size of W. subtorquata colonies and the abundance and diversity of epibionts. To test this, we compared recruitment of fouling organisms to mimic W. subtorquata colonies of three different sizes that had the same total surface area. Secondary recruitment to mimic colonies was greater when the surrounding paint surface contained biocides. Contrary to our predictions, epibionts were most abundant on small mimic colonies with a large total perimeter. This pattern was observed in encrusting and erect bryozoans, tubiculous amphipods, and serpulid and sabellid polychaetes, but only in the presence of toxic paint. Our results show that W. subtorquata acts as a foundation species for fouling assemblages on ship hulls and facilitates the transport of other species at greater abundance and frequency than would otherwise be possible. Invasion success may be increased by positive interactions between NIS that enhance the delivery of propagules by human transport vectors."

Here, we evaluated the consequences that restoring top-down herbivore population control has on plants and birds. Location Forest ecosystems of Haida Gwaii (British Columbia, Canada) where introduced black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus) have dramatically limited tree regeneration and simplified understorey plant, insect and bird assemblages. Methods We experimentally assessed ecosystem-wide responses of plant and bird communities to a similar to 80% reduction of deer abundance on two mediumsized islands (146 and 249 ha). We monitored changes in plant and bird communities for the 13 years following the start of culling and used two islands without culling and a set of exclosures as controls. Results Native plant communities increased in cover and richness after culling, while introduced plants decreased. Birds that depend on understorey vegetation for feeding and/or breeding increased significantly after deer were reduced in abundance but species not dependent on understorey vegetation did not. Finally, on control islands, plant and bird communities were stable or declined throughout the study period. Main conclusions Biodiversity losses caused by current continental-scale trends of increasing deer populations are potentially reversible. We demonstrate that controlling large herbivore populations (native or introduced) offers significant conservation benefits to forest understorey plant communities, even to those most negatively affected by uncontrolled browsing. We also report, for the first time, strong evidence that higher trophic levels (birds) can respond rapidly and positively to herbivore density control."

Protection from vertebrates significantly increased recovery of seeds; vertebrate exclusion produced higher recovery than controls for 30 of the experimental species, increasing overall seed recovery from 38.2 to 45.6%. Losses to vertebrates varied among species, significantly increasing with seed mass. In contrast, insect exclusion did not significantly improve seed recovery. There was no evidence that aliens benefitted from a reduced rate of post-dispersal seed predation. The impacts of seed predators did not differ significantly between natives and exotics, which instead showed very similar responses to predator exclusion treatments. These results indicate that while vertebrate granivores had important impacts, especially on large-seeded species, exotics did not generally benefit from reduced rates of seed predation. Instead, differences between natives and exotics were small compared with interspecific variation within these groups."

More fragments were produced at medium to high crayfish densities, with a significant reduction of milfoil only at the highest densities, demonstrating the potential for both positive and negative interactions. Second, we determined the habitat preferences of each species by conducting a survey in the same lake. There was little overlap in the species' distributions, with each preferring different habitat features, indicating either a low probability of interaction or that interaction occurred historically, resulting in a contemporary exclusion pattern.

Were these differences consistent through time? LocationEast-central Arizona, southwestern US. Methods We used a multi-year data set from the 2002 Rodeo-Chediski Fire to detect post-fire trends in plant community response in burned ponderosa pine forests. Within the burn perimeter, we examined the effects of pre-fire fuels treatments on post-fire vegetation by comparing paired treated and untreated sites on the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest. We sampled these paired sites in 2004, 2005 and 2011. ResultsThere were significant differences in pre-fire treated and untreated plant communities by species composition and abundance in 2004 and 2005, but these communities were beginning to converge in 2011. Total understorey plant cover was significantly higher in untreated areas for all 3 yr. Plant cover generally increased between 2004 and 2005 and markedly decreased in 2011, with the exception of shrub cover, which steadily increased through time. The sharp decrease in forb and graminoid cover in 2011 is likely related to drought conditions since the fire. Annual/biennial forb and graminoid cover decreased relative to perennial cover through time, consistent with the initial floristics hypothesis. Exotic plant response was highly variable and not limited to the immediate post-fire, annual/biennial community. Despite low overall exotic forb and graminoid cover for all years ( Conclusions Pre-treatment fuel reduction treatments helped maintain foundation overstorey species and associated native plant communities following this large wildfire. The overall low cover of exotic species on these sites supports other findings that the disturbance associated with high-severity fire does not always result in exotic species invasions. The increase in relative cover and frequency though time indicates that some species are proliferating, and continued monitoring is recommended. Patterns of exotic species invasions after severe burning are not easily predicted, and are likely more dependent on site-specific factors such as propagules, weather patterns and management."

Location Europe (for native species); the rest of the world and North America in particular (for alien species). Methods We selected 14 congeneric pairs of European herbaceous species that have all been introduced elsewhere. One species of each pair is highly invasive elsewhere in the world, particularly so in North America, whereas the other species has not become invasive or has spread only to a limited degree. We grew native plant material of the 28 species under shaded and non-shaded conditions in a common garden experiment, and measured biomass production and morphological traits that are frequently related to shade tolerance and avoidance. Results Invasive species had higher shoot-root ratios, tended to have longer leaf-blades, and produced more biomass than congeneric non-invasive species both under shaded and non-shaded conditions. Plants responded to shading by increasing shoot-root ratios and specific leaf area. Surprisingly, these shade-induced responses, which are widely considered to be adaptive, did not differ between invasive and non-invasive species. Main conclusions We conclude that high biomass production across different light environments pre-adapts species to become invasive, and that this is not mediated by plasticities of the morphological traits that we measured."

We investigated the potential for the introduced cephalaspidean sea slug Philine orientalis to interfere with the feeding of the introduced European green crab (Carcinus maenas) and the native Dungeness crab (Cancer magister). We observed co-occurrence of crab species and P. orientalis at field sites in Bodega Harbor and Tomales, San Pablo, and San Francisco Bays. In laboratory and field experiments, we determined whether crab feeding was suppressed by P. orientalis and the duration of this suppression for individual crabs. We also used foraging response models to explore changes in the feeding rate of crabs with varying densities of P. orientalis and small bivalve prey. We found that P. orientalis deterred predation by green and Dungeness crabs on small clams in laboratory feeding trials, but not in field experiments with green crabs and P. orientalis. Foraging models predicted that P. orientalis would only affect crab feeding in the field under specific conditions of crab, P. orientalis, and prey densities. These foraging models bridged an important gap between lab and field experiments and allowed us to predict how changes in species abundances at two trophic levels might alter the importance of crab suppression by P. orientalis."

The exotic cladoceran Daphnia lumholtzi has recently invaded freshwater systems throughout the United States. Daphnia lumholtzi possesses extravagant head spines that are longer than those found on any other North American Daphnia. These spines are effective at reducing predation from many of the predators that are native to newly invaded habitats; however, they are plastic both in nature and in laboratory cultures. The purpose of this experiment was to better understand what environmental cues induce and maintain these effective predator-deterrent spines. We conducted life-table experiments on individual D. lumholtzi grown in water conditioned with an invertebrate insect predator, Chaoborus punctipennis, and water conditioned with a vertebrate fish predator, Lepomis macrochirus. 2. Daphnia lumholtzi exhibited morphological plasticity in response to kairomones released by both predators. However, direct exposure to predator kairomones during postembryonic development did not induce long spines in D. lumholtzi. In contrast, neonates produced from individuals exposed to Lepomis kairomones had significantly longer head and tail spines than neonates produced from control and Chaoborus individuals. These results suggest that there may be a maternal, or pre-embryonic, effect of kairomone exposure on spine development in D. lumholtzi. 3. Independent of these morphological shifts, D. lumholtzi also exhibited plasticity in life history characteristics in response to predator kairomones. For example, D. lumholtzi exhibited delayed reproduction in response to Chaoborus kairomones, and significantly more individuals produced resting eggs, or ephippia, in the presence of Lepomis kairomones."

All species that had been introduced to more than 10 jurisdictions (34 species) had established at least one alien population. We also conducted more detailed quantitative comparisons for successful (69 species) and failed (116 species) introductions to three jurisdictions (Great Britain, California and Florida) to test for associations with climate match, geographic range size, and history of establishment success elsewhere. Relative to failed species, successful species had better climate matches between the jurisdiction where they were introduced and their geographic range elsewhere in the world. Successful species were also more likely to have high establishment success rates elsewhere in the world. Cross-validations indicated our full model correctly categorized establishment success with 78-80% accuracy.

These three exotic species, or ""exotic triad,"" may impact nearshore benthic communities due to their locally high abundances and expanding distributions. Laboratory experiments were conducted to determine (1) whether ruffe and gobies may compete for habitat and invertebrate food in benthic environments, and (2) if zebra mussels can alter those competitive relationships by serving as an alternate food source for gobies. In laboratory mesocosms, both gobies and ruffe preferred cobble and macrophyte areas to open sand either when alone or in sympatry. In a 9-week goby-ruffe competition experiment simulating an invasion scenario with a limited food base, gobies grew faster than did ruffe, suggesting that gobies may be competitively superior at low resource levels. When zebra mussels were added in a short-term experiment, the presence or absence of mussels did not affect goby or ruffe growth, as few zebra mussels were consumed. This finding, along with other laboratory evidence, suggests that gobies may prefer soft-bodied invertebrate prey over zebra mussels. Studies of interactions among the ""exotic triad"", combined with continued surveillance, may help Great Lakes fisheries managers to predict future population sizes and distributions of these invasive fish, evaluate their impacts on native food webs, and direct possible control measures to appropriate species."

The results were used to seek evidence of invasive potential among four recently naturalized species. There was evidence that invasive species tend to accumulate more biomass than native species (P = 0.0788). Root:shoot allocation did not differ between native and invasive plant species, nor was allocation affected by nutrient addition. However, the photosynthetic surface area of invasive species tended to increase with nutrients, whereas it did not among native species (P = 0.0658). Of the four recently naturalized species, Hydrocleys nymphoides showed the same nutrient-related plasticity in photosynthetic area displayed by known invasive species. Cyperus papyrus showed a strong reduction in photosynthetic area with increased nutrients. H. nymphoides and C. papyrus also accumulated more biomass than their native relatives. H. nymphoides possesses both of the traits we found to be associated with invasiveness, and should thus be regarded as likely to be invasive."

Little information is available, however, about effects of earthworm invasions outside of temperate and boreal forests, particularly about invasions of islands. For San Clemente Island (SCI), California (USA) - an oceanic island with numerous endemic and endangered plant and vertebrate species - we assessed the spatial extent and drivers of earthworm invasion and examined relationships between earthworms and plant and soil microbial communities. Location San Clemente Island, southern California, USA. Methods Using a stratified random sampling approach, we sampled earthworms, vegetation, soils and microbial communities across SCI. We examined the relationship between the presence of invasive earthworms and soil and landscape variables using logistic regression models and implemented a spatial representation of the best model to represent potential site suitability for earthworms. We evaluated the relationship between invasive earthworms and vegetation and microbial variables using ANOVA. Results We found that the likelihood of encountering earthworms increased close to roads and streams and in high moisture conditions, which correspond to higher elevation and a north-eastern aspect on SCI. The presence of earthworms was positively associated with total ground vegetation cover, grass cover and non-native plant cover; however, there was no significant relationship between earthworms and microbial biomass. These results suggest that the earthworm invasion on SCI is at an early stage and closely tied to roads and high moisture conditions. Main conclusions Climatic variables and potential sources of earthworm introduction and dispersal (e.g. roads and streams) should be broadly useful for predicting current and future sites of earthworm invasions on both islands and continents. Furthermore, the significant positive relationship between non-native plant cover and invasive earthworm presence raises the possibility of an emerging invasional 'meltdown' on SCI. Additional study of earthworm invasions on human-inhabited oceanic islands is necessary to identify additional invasions and their potential for negative impacts on unique insular biota."

Weed status in Australia was associated with being geographically widespread in southern Africa, being found in a wide range of climates in southern Africa, being described as a weed or targeted by herbicides in southern Africa, with early introduction and establishment in Australia, and with weediness in regions other than southern Africa. Multiple logistic regressions were used to identify the variables that best predicted weed status. The best fitting regressions were for weeds present for a long time in Australia (more than 140 years). They utilized three variables, namely weed status, climatic range in southern Africa and the existence of congeneric weeds in southern Africa. The highest level of variation explained (43%) was obtained for agricultural weeds using a single variable, weed status in southern Africa. Being recorded as a weed in Australia was related to climatic range and the existence of congeneric weeds in southern Africa (40% of variation explained). No variables were suitable predictors of non-agricultural (environmental) weeds. The regressions were used to predict future weed status of plants either not introduced or recently arrived in Australia. Recently-arrived species which were predicted to become weeds are Acacia karroo Hayne (Mimosaceae), Arctotis venustra T. Norl. (Asteraceae), Sisymbrium thellungii O.E. Schulz (Brassicaceae) and Solanum retroflexum Dun. (Solanaceae). Twenty species not yet arrived in Australia were predicted to have a high likelihood of becoming weeds. Analysis of the residuals of the regressions indicated two long-established species which might prove to be good targets for biological control: Mesembryanthemum crystallinum L. (Aizoaceae) and Watsonia meriana (L.) Mill. (Iridaceae)."

The Cape Peninsula, South Africa, provides a case study of the threat of alien plants to native plant diversity. We sought to identify where alien plants would invade the landscape and what their threat to plant diversity could be. This information is needed to develop a strategy for managing these invasions at the landscape scale. We used logistic regression models to predict the potential distribution of six important invasive alien plants in relation to several environmental variables. The logistic regression models showed that alien plants could cover over 89% of the Cape Peninsula. Acacia cyclops and Pinus Pinaster were predicted to cover the greatest area. These predictions were overlaid on the current distribution of native plant diversity for the Cape Peninsula in order to quantify the threat of alien plants to native plant diversity. We defined the threat to native plant diversity as the number of native plant species (divided into all species, rare and threatened species, and endemic species) whose entire range is covered by the predicted distribution of alien plant species. We used a null model, which assumed a random distribution of invaded sites, to assess whether area invaded is confounded with threat to native plant diversity. The null model showed that most alien species threaten more plant species than might be suggested by the area they are predicted to invade. For instance, the logistic regression model predicted that P. pinaster threatens 350 more native species, 29 more rare and threatened species, and 21 more endemic species than the null model would predict. Comparisons between the null and logistic regression models suggest that species richness and invasibility are positively correlated and that species richness is a poor indicator of invasive resistance in the study site. Our results emphasize the importance of adopting a spatially explicit approach to quantifying threats to biodiversity, and they provide the information needed to prioritize threats from alien species and the sites that need urgent management intervention."

I used logistic regression analysis to sort among potential intrinsic, community and landscape variables that theoretically influence introduction success. I utilized the avian fauna of the Everglades of South Florida, and the variables body mass, distance to nearest neighbor (in terms of body mass), year of introduction, presence of congeners, guild membership, continent of origin, distribution in a body mass aggregation or gap, and distance to body-mass aggregation edge (in terms of body mass). Two variables were significant predictors of introduction success. Introduced avian species whose body mass placed them nearer to a body-mass aggregation edge and further from their neighbor were more likely to become successfully established. This suggests that community interactions, and community level phenomena, may be better understood by explicitly incorporating scale."

We used Florida, USA, as our study system because it has a well-documented history of introduction and invasion, and is a hotspot for biological invasions. Location Florida, USA. Methods We analysed non-indigenous species (NIS) data from peninsular Florida - which included both successful and unsuccessful introductions from all vertebrate classes - to determine the best predictors of both establishment and spread for fish (65 species), herpetofauna (63 species), birds (71 species) and mammals (25 species). We used 10 variables proposed to be associated with the establishment and spread of NIS: body mass, geographic origin, reproductive rate, diet generalism, native-range size, latitude of native range, number of NIS present at date of introduction, presence of NIS congeners, morphological proximity to other NIS (in terms of body mass) and propagule pressure. A multimodel selection process was used with an information-theoretic approach to determine the best fit models for predicting establishment and spread of NIS. We selected a priori plausible predictive models for establishment and spread. Results Large native-range size and small body mass best predicted establishment of non-indigenous herpetofauna. The presence of NIS congeners had the largest positive effect on the establishment of non-indigenous fish. For mammals, the number of NIS present at the time of introduction best explained establishment. No single model best explained bird establishment. For all taxa but birds, the number of NIS present at time of introduction was included in at least one of the best-supported models for explaining spread. Main conclusions Our analyses suggest that predictors of establishment and spread differ across vertebrate taxa at the scale studied. Most predictive variables can be interpreted as measures of competitive interactions among species."

We examined the gammarid ability to select a habitat containing living mussels and searched for cues used in that selection. We hypothesized that they may respond to such traits of a living mussel as byssal threads, activity (e.g. valve movements, filtration) and/or shell surface properties. We conducted the pairwise habitat-choice experiments in which we offered various objects to single gammarids in the following combinations: (1) living mussels versus empty shells (the general effect of living Dreissena); (2) living mussels versus shells with added byssal threads and shells with byssus versus shells without it (the effect of byssus); (3) living mussels versus shells, both coated with nail varnish to neutralize the shell surface (the effect of mussel activity); (4) varnished versus clean living mussels (the effect of shell surface); (5) varnished versus clean stones (the effect of varnish). We checked the gammarid positions in the experimental tanks after 24 h. The gammarids preferred clean living mussels over clean shells, regardless of the presence of byssal threads under the latter. They responded to the shell surface, exhibiting preferences for clean mussels over varnished individuals. They were neither affected by the presence of byssus nor by mussel activity.

Not all comparisons of introduced populations to the native population were consistent with expectations of the enemy release hypothesis. Native populations show greater overall parasite prevalence than introduced populations, but the lower prevalence in introduced populations is driven by low prevalence in two populations on oceanic islands (Fiji and Hawaii). When these are excluded, prevalence does not differ significantly. We found a similar number of parasite lineages in native populations compared to all introduced populations. Although there is some evidence that common mynas may have carried parasite lineages from native to introduced locations, and also that introduced populations may have become infected with novel parasite lineages, it may be difficult to differentiate between parasites that are native and introduced, because malarial parasite lineages often do not show regional or host specificity."

Although the small-scale negative relationship between native and exotic diversity has a satisfactory explanation, we lack a mechanistic explanation for the change in relationship to positive at large scales. We investigated the native-exotic diversity relationship at three scales (range: 1-4000 km(2)) in California serpentine, a system with a wide range in the productivity of sites from harsh to lush. Native and exotic diversity were positively correlated at all three scales; it is rarer to detect a positive relationship at the small scales within which interactions between individuals occur. However, although positively correlated on average, the small-scale relationship between native and exotic diversity was positive at low-productivity sites and negative at high-productivity sites: Thus, the change in the relationship between native and exotic diversity does not depend on spatial scale per se, but occurs whenever environmental conditions change to promote species coexistence rather than competitive exclusion. This occurred within a single spatial scale when the environment shifted from being locally unproductive to productive."

Invasibility of a resident community may be affected by a complex but hitherto hardly understood interplay of (1) productivity of the habitat, (2) diversity, (3) herbivory, and (4) the characteristics of both invasive and resident species. Using experimental phytoplankton microcosms, we investigated the effect of nutrient supply and species diversity on the invasibility of resident communities for two functionally different invaders in the presence or absence of an herbivore. With increasing nutrient supply, increased herbivore abundance indicated enhanced phytoplankton biomass production, and the invasion success of both invaders showed a unimodal pattern. At low nutrient supply (i.e., low influence of herbivory), the invasibility depended mainly on the competitive abilities of the invaders, whereas at high nutrient supply, the susceptibility to herbivory dominated. This resulted in different optimum nutrient levels for invasion success of the two species due to their individual functional traits. To test the effect of diversity on invasibility, a species richness gradient was generated by random selection from a resident species pool at an intermediate nutrient level. Invasibility was not affected by species richness; instead, it was driven by the functional traits of the resident and/or invasive species mediated by herbivore density. Overall, herbivory was the driving factor for invasibility of phytoplankton communities, which implies that other factors affecting the intensity of herbivory (e.g., productivity or edibility of primary producers) indirectly influence invasions."

Using four different treatments (three exclosure types) at flower heads, we observed visitation rates of different pollinators. Honey bees were the most common visitors at each of three transects established at three study locales in California: University of California at Davis, Cosumnes River Preserve. and Santa Cruz Island. A significant correlation existed between honey bee visitation levels monitored in all these transects and the average number of viable seeds per seed head for the same transects. Selective exclusion of honey bees at flower heads using a 3 mm diameter mesh significantly reduced seed set per seed head at all locales. Seed set depression was less dramatic at the island locale because of high visitation rates by generalist halictid bees Augochlorella pomoniella and Agapostemon texanus that penetrated the 3-mm mesh. The introduced megachilid bee Megachile apicalis occurred at all three locales as well (though in much lower numbers) and may contribute to pollination. In an ancillary study, seed set of plants with bagged heads was compared with that of plants without any bagged heads to test for resource shunting effects. These results showed that seed set differences observed between treatments within a single plant were not exaggerated due to resource shunting induced by the bagging technique. Yellow star-thistle may have low or variable levels of self-compatibility (as reflected by low seed set levels in small-mesh bags), increasing the importance of pollination in its breeding system. These results suggest that honey bees and yellow star-thistle may act as invasive mutualists, an association that may extend to other normative plant and pollinator species from Eurasia."

The immediate source of ants in Wuchuan appears to be somewhere near Texas, which ranks first among the southern USA infested states in the exportation of goods to China. Most colonies from spatially distant, outlying areas in China are genetically similar to one another and appear to share a common source (Wuchuan, Guangdong Province), suggesting that long-distance jump dispersal has been a prevalent means of recent spread of fire ants in China. Furthermore, most colonies at outlier sites are of the polygyne social form (featuring multiple egg-laying queens per nest), reinforcing the important role of this social form in the successful invasion of new areas and subsequent range expansion following invasion. Several analyses consistently revealed characteristic signatures of genetic bottlenecks for S. invicta populations in China. The results of this study highlight the invasive potential of this pest ant, suggest that the magnitude of international trade may serve as a predictor of propagule pressure and indicate that rates and patterns of subsequent range expansion are partly determined by the interplay between species traits and the trade and transportation networks."

Few studies have manipulated or controlled for propagule supply in the field, and consequently there is little empirical data to test for non-linearities or interactions with other processes. Supply of non-indigenous propagules is most likely to be elevated in urban estuaries, where vessels congregate and bring exotic species on fouled hulls and in ballast water. These same environments are also typically subject to elevated levels of disturbance from human activities, creating the potential for propagule pressure and disturbance to interact. By applying a controlled dose of free-swimming larvae to replicate assemblages, we were able to quantify a dose-response relationship at much finer spatial and temporal scales than previously achieved in the marine environment. We experimentally crossed controlled levels of propagule pressure and disturbance in the field, and found that both were required for invasion to occur. Only recruits that had settled onto bare space survived beyond three months, precluding invader persistence in undisturbed communities. In disturbed communities initial survival on bare space appeared stochastic, such that a critical density was required before the probability of at least one colony surviving reached a sufficient level. Those that persisted showed 75% survival over the following three months, signifying a threshold past which invaders were resilient to chance mortality. Urban estuaries subject to anthropogenic disturbance are common throughout the world, and similar interactions may be integral to invasion dynamics in these ecosystems."

The main pathways of introduction were via imports of fishes for ornamental use (e.g. aquaria and garden ponds) and sport fishing, with no reported or suspected cases of ballast water or hull fouling introductions. The recorded occurrence of non-native fishes in the wild was found to be related to the time (number of years) since the decade of introduction. A shift in the establishment rate, however, was observed in the 1970s after which the ratio of established-to-introduced species declined. The number of established non-native fish species observed in the wild was found to increase significantly (P < 0-05) with increasing import intensity (log(10)x + 1 of the numbers of fish imported for the years 2000-2004) and with increasing consignment diversity (log(10)x + 1 of the numbers of consignment types imported for the years 2000-2004).

Here, we explore the implications of this alternative hypothesis, and derive six a priori predictions from it. We test these predictions using data on Acclimatization Society introductions of passerine bird species to New Zealand, which have previously been used to support both hypotheses for the direction of causality. All our predictions are falsified. This study reaffirms that the conventional paradigm in invasion biology is indeed the correct one for New Zealand passerine bird introductions, for which numbers released determine establishment success.

Natural experiments can be used to quantify the role of this factor relative to others in driving establishment success. An irrigation network in South Africa takes water from an inter-basin water transfer (IBWT) scheme to supply multiple small irrigation ponds. We compared fish community composition upstream, within, and downstream of the irrigation network, to show that this system is a unidirectional dispersal network with a single immigration source. We then assessed the effect of propagule pressure and biological adaptation on the colonization success of nine fish species across 30 recipient ponds of varying age. Establishing species received significantly more propagules at the source than did incidental species, while rates of establishment across the ponds displayed a saturation response to propagule pressure. This shows that propagule pressure is a significant driver of establishment overall. Those species that did not establish were either extremely rare at the immigration source or lacked the reproductive adaptations to breed in the ponds. The ability of all nine species to arrive at some of the ponds illustrates how long-term continuous propagule pressure from IBWT infrastructure enables range expansion of fishes. The quantitative link between propagule pressure and success and rate of population establishment confirms the driving role of this factor in fish invasion ecology."

Interactions affecting the invasion are undocumented. We tested the effects of native species richness and composition on invasibility by constructing isolated reef communities with 0, 2, or 4 of the most common native species, by seeding adult P. armatus into a subset of the 4 native species communities and by constructing communities with and without native, predatory mud crabs. At 4 wk, recruitment of R armatus juveniles to oyster shells lacking native species was 2.75 times greater than to the 2 native species treatment and 3.75 times greater than to the 4 native species treatment. The biotic resistance produced by 2 species of native filter feeders may have occurred due to competition with, or predation on, the settling juveniles of the filter feeding invasive crab. Adding adult porcelain crabs to communities with 4 native species enhanced recruitment by a significant 3-fold, and countered the effects of native biotic resistance. Differences in recruitment at Week 4 were lost by Weeks 8 and 12, when densities of recent recruits reached similar to 17 000 to 34 000 crabs m(-2) across all treatments. Thus, native species richness slows initial invasion, but early colonists stimulate settlement by later ones and produce tremendous propagule pressure that overwhelms the effects of biotic resistance."

Here, we demonstrate a method for quantifying the community-level impact of multiple plant invaders by applying Parker et al.'s (1999) equation (impact = range x local abundance x per capita effect or per unit effect) using data from 620 survey plots from 31 grasslands across west-central Montana, USA. In testing for interactive effects of multiple invaders on native plant abundance (percent cover), we found no evidence for invasional meltdown or synergistic interactions for the 25 exotics tested. While much concern exists regarding impact thresholds, we also found little evidence for nonlinear relationships between invader abundance and impacts. These results suggest that management actions that reduce invader abundance should reduce invader impacts monotonically in this system. Eleven of 25 invaders had significant per unit impacts (negative local-scale relationships between invader and native cover). In decomposing the components of impact, we found that local invader abundance had a significant influence on the likelihood of impact, but range (number of plots occupied) did not. This analysis helped to differentiate measures of invasiveness (local abundance and range) from impact to distinguish high-impact invaders from invaders that exhibit negligible impacts, even when widespread. Distinguishing between high-and low-impact invaders should help refine trait-based prediction of problem species. Despite the unique information derived from evaluation of per unit effects of invaders, invasiveness scores based on range and local abundance produced similar rankings to impact scores that incorporated estimates of per unit effects. Hence, information on range and local abundance alone was sufficient to identify problematic plant invaders at the regional scale. In comparing empirical data on invader impacts to the state noxious weed list, we found that the noxious weed list captured 45% of the high-impact invaders but missed 55% and assigned the lowest risk category to the highest-impact invader. While such subjective weed lists help to guide invasive species management, empirical data are needed to develop more comprehensive rankings of ecological impacts. Using weed lists to classify invaders for testing invasion theory is not well supported."

We report the impact of an extreme weather event, the October 1987 severe storm, on fragmented woodlands in southern Britain. We analysed ecological changes between 1971 and 2002 in 143 200-m(2) plots in 10 woodland sites exposed to the storm with an ecologically equivalent sample of 150 plots in 16 non-exposed sites. Comparing both years, understorey plant species-richness, species composition, soil pH and woody basal area of the tree and shrub canopy were measured. 2. We tested the hypothesis that the storm had deflected sites from the wider national trajectory of an increase in woody basal area and reduced understorey species-richness associated with ageing canopies and declining woodland management. We also expected storm disturbance to amplify the background trend of increasing soil pH, a UK-wide response to reduced atmospheric sulphur deposition. Path analysis was used to quantify indirect effects of storm exposure on understorey species richness via changes in woody basal area and soil pH. 3. By 2002, storm exposure was estimated to have increased mean species richness per 200 m(2) by 32%. Woody basal area changes were highly variable and did not significantly differ with storm exposure. 4. Increasing soil pH was associated with a 7% increase in richness. There was no evidence that soil pH increased more as a function of storm exposure. Changes in species richness and basal area were negatively correlated: a 3.4% decrease in richness occurred for every 0.1-m(2) increase in woody basal area per plot. 5. Despite all sites substantially exceeding the empirical critical load for nitrogen deposition, there was no evidence that in the 15 years since the storm, disturbance had triggered a eutrophication effect associated with dominance of gaps by nitrophilous species. 6. Synthesis. Although the impacts of the 1987 storm were spatially variable in terms of impacts on woody basal area, the storm had a positive effect on understorey species richness. There was no evidence that disturbance had increased dominance of gaps by invasive species. This could change if recovery from acidification results in a soil pH regime associated with greater macronutrient availability."

LocationEurope. MethodsWe quantified propagule pressure, climate-matching and host availability by aggregating large global databases for trade, European arthropod interceptions, Koeppen-Geiger world climate classification (including the A1F1 climate change scenario until 2100) and host plant distributions for 118 quarantine arthropod species. ResultsAs expected, all the three factors, propagule pressure, climate suitability and host availability, significantly explained quarantine arthropod invasions in Europe, but the propagule pressure only had a positive effect on invasion success when considered together with climate suitability and host availability. Climate change according to the A1F1 scenario generally increased the climate suitability of north-eastern European countries and reduced the climate suitability of central European countries for pest arthropod invasions. Main conclusionsTo our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that propagule pressure interacts with other factors to drive invasions and is not alone sufficient to explain arthropod establishment patterns. European countries with more suitable climate and large agricultural areas of suitable host plants for pest arthropods should thus be more vigilant about introduction pathways. Moreover, efforts to reduce the propagule pressure, such as preventing pests from entering pathways and strengthening border controls, will become more important in north-eastern Europe in the future as the climate becomes more favourable to arthropod invasions."

We report the results of research on the hemlock woolly adelgid Adelges tsugae ('HWA') and elongate hemlock scale Fiorinia externa ('EHS'), invasive herbivores that both feed on eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis). HWA has been linked to hemlock mortality throughout the East Coast of the US; the loss of hemlock threatens to permanently alter surrounding ecosystems. We assessed the spread and impact of both species by resurveying 142 hemlock stands across a 7,500 km(2) latitudinal transect, running from coastal CT to northern MA, for HWA and EHS density as well as hemlock mortality. These stands had been previously surveyed in either 1997-1998 (CT) or 2002-2004 (MA). While the number of HWA-infested stands has increased, per-stand HWA density has substantially decreased. In contrast, EHS distribution and density has increased dramatically since 1997-1998. Hemlock mortality was much more strongly related to HWA density than to EHS density, and many stands remain relatively healthy despite an overall increase in hemlock mortality. There was a positive correlation between HWA and EHS densities in stands with low mean HWA densities, suggesting the potential for host-plant-mediated facilitation of EHS by HWA. Our findings underline the importance of research explicitly addressing interactions between competing invasive species, and of determining the potential consequences of these interactions for the invaded ecosystem."

Historically, this species was not known to be present in the central region of European Russia. Since 2007, however, specimens of A. convexicollis have been collected in seven central European Russia localities, effectively expanding the northern border of the previously known range by approximately 665 km. All recently established localities of A. convexicollis are within the region invaded by emerald ash borer (A. planipennis Fairmaire), an East Asian pest of ashes that was first detected in European Russia in 2003. In addition, almost all A. convexicollis specimens from central European Russia (both adults and larvae) were collected from declining F. pennsylvanica (an introduced North American ash) infested with A. planipennis. This is a new host record for A. convexicollis. We suspect that the recent range expansion of A. convexicollis in central European Russia has been facilitated by the A. planipennis invasion, which has caused widespread decline and mortality of ash trees in the region. This work illustrates how the invasion of one species can facilitate the range expansion of another."

Adult round goby morphology suggests low dispersal and migration potential due to the lack of a swim bladder and benthic life style. Given that the larval stage occurs inside the benthic egg, and juveniles have adult morphologies, it has been suspected that dispersal and invasion potential is low for early life stages also. However, we identified early juvenile round gobies in the nocturnal pelagic in Lake Erie and thus we conducted a sampling study to determine the extent to which this life stage uses the nocturnal pelagic. Replicate ichthyoplankton samples were collected at 3-h intervals (1900-0700 h) at three depths (2 m, 5 m, 8 m) in western Lake Erie (water depth = 10 m) in July and August 2002 and June 2006. Early juvenile round gobies (6-23 mm TL) were present almost exclusively in the nocturnal samples (2200 h, 0100 h, 0400 h) with peak densities approaching 60 individuals per 100 m(3) of water sampled. Nocturnal density was also significantly greater at 8-m depth versus 2-m and only the smallest fish (6-8 mm TL) migrated to the surface (2-m). Analyses of diet clearly demonstrated that these fish are foraging on plankton at night and thus may not be light limited for foraging in ship ballast tanks. In ships that take on thousands of tonnes of water for ballast, nocturnal ballasting could easily result in transport of thousands of young round gobies at a time. Additionally, within-lake dispersal at this lifestage is likely common and may facilitate downstream passage across barriers designed to limit range expansion."

We examined the evolutionary response of native zooplankton populations to the introduction of non-native salmonids in alpine lakes in the Sierra Nevada of California, USA. We compared morphological and life-history traits in populations of Daphnia with a known history of introduced salmonids and populations that have no history of salmonid introductions. Results: Our results show that Daphnia populations co-existing with fish have undergone rapid adaptive reductions in body size and in the timing of reproduction. Size-related traits decreased by up to 13 percent in response to introduced fish. Rates of evolutionary change are as high as 4,238 darwins (0.036 haldanes). Conclusion: Species introductions into aquatic habitats can dramatically alter the selective environment of native species leading to a rapid evolutionary response. Knowledge of the rates and limits of adaptation is an important component of understanding the long-term effects of alterations in the species composition of communities. We discuss the evolutionary consequences of species introductions and compare the rate of evolution observed in the Sierra Nevada Daphnia to published estimates of evolutionary change in ecological timescales."

We studied the effects of major disturbance by severe storms on the indigenous mussel Perna perna and the invasive mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis in sympatric intertidal populations on the south coast of South Africa. At the study sites, these species dominate different shore levels and co-exist in the mid mussel zone. We tested the hypotheses that in the mid-zone P. perna would suffer less dislodgment than M galloprovincialis, because of its greater tenacity, while M. galloprovincialis would respond with a higher re-colonisation rate. We estimated the percent cover of the 2 mussels in the mid-zone from photographs, once before severe storms and 3 times afterwards. M galloprovincialis showed faster re-colonisation and 3 times more cover than P. perna 1 and 1.5 yr after the storms (when populations had recovered). Storm-driven dislodgment in the mid-zone was highest for the species that initially dominated at each site, conforming to the concept of compensatory mortality, This resulted in similar cover of the 2 species immediately after the storms. Thus, the storm wave forces exceeded the tenacity even of F perna, while the higher recruitment rate of M galloprovincialis can explain its greater colonisation ability. We predict that, because of its weaker attachment strength, M galloprovincialis will be largely excluded from open coast sites where wave action is generally stronger, but that its greater capacity for exploitation competition through re-colonisation will allow it to outcompete P. perna in more sheltered areas (especially in bays) that are periodically disturbed by storms."

The majority of experiments examining effects of species diversity on ecosystem functioning have randomly manipulated species richness. More recent studies demonstrate that realistic species losses have dramatically different effects on ecosystem functioning than those of randomized losses, but these results are based primarily on microcosm experiments or modelling efforts. 2. We conducted a field-based experiment directly comparing the consequences of realistic and randomized plant species losses on invasion resistance and productivity in a native-dominated serpentine grassland in California, USA. The realistic species loss order was based on nested subset analysis of long-term presence/absence data from our research site and reflects differing species sensitivities to prolonged drought. 3. Biomass of exotic invasive plant species was inversely related to native species richness in the realistic loss order. In contrast, invader biomass was consistently low across species richness levels in the randomized species loss order, with no effect of native species richness on invader biomass among randomized assemblages. Although total above-ground plant biomass increased with soil depth (a proxy for resource availability) in both realistic and randomized assemblages, soil depth influenced invader biomass only in the randomized assemblages. 4. Synthesis. Our results illustrate that the functional consequences of realistic species losses can differ distinctly from those of randomized species losses and that incorporation of realistic species loss scenarios can increase the relevance of experiments linking biodiversity and ecosystem functioning to conservation in the face of anthropogenic global change."

Progressive species removals from microcosm communities, designed to mimic nested variation in diversity observed in the field, reduced grassland production, resistance to intentional invasions, and resistance to natural colonization by new species. Three lines of evidence point to the particular importance of intensified competition within a single functional group-late-active forbs-in explaining the observed effects of realistic species loss order on community resistance. First, reduced success of naturally colonizing species in more diverse assemblages was dominated by declining colonization by late-active forbs. Second, increasing late-active forb biomass appeared to reduce the biomass of intentionally introduced yellow starthistle (Centaurea solstitialis, a late-season forb) both within and across diversity levels. Finally, starthistle addition reduced biomass of resident late-season forbs but not of any other functional group. Increasing diversity increased light levels and soil moisture availability in spring and summer, providing a proximate mechanism linking our realistic species loss order to decreased community resistance. Starthistle addition reduced light and soil moisture availability but not N across richness levels, mirroring the apparent effects of the additional late-active forb species present in higher diversity treatments. Species losses that entail the early loss of whole or key functional groups could, through mechanisms like those we explore, have greater ecosystem consequences than those suggested by randomized-loss experiments."

Indeed, profound. effects of some parasites and predators on host populations are well documented. However, some support for the ERH comes from studies that find a reduction in the species richness of enemies in the introduced range, relative to the native range, of particular hosts. For example, data on helminth parasites of the European starling in both its native Eurasia and in North America support a reduction of parasites in the latter. However, North American 'founder' starlings were likely not chosen randomly from across Eurasia. This could result in an overestimation of enemy release since enemies affect their hosts on a population level. We control for the effects of subsampling colonists and find, contrary to previous reports, no evidence that introduced populations of starlings experienced a reduction in the species richness of helminth parasites after colonization of North America. These results highlight the importance of choosing appropriate contrast groups in biogeographical analyses of biological invasions to minimize the confounding effects of 'propagule biases'."

In coastal waters of the U.S., >500 invaders have become established, and new introductions continue at an increasing rate. Although most species have little impact on native communities, some initially benign introductions may occasionally turn into damaging invasions, although such introductions are rarely documented. Here, I demonstrate that a recently introduced crab has resulted in the rapid spread and increase of an introduced bivalve that had been rare in the system for nearly 50 yr. This increase has occurred through the positive indirect effects of predation by the introduced crab on native bivalves. I used field and laboratory experiments to show that the mechanism is size-specific predation interacting with the different reproductive life histories of the native (protandrous hermaphrodite) and the introduced (dioecious) bivalves. These results suggest that positive interactions among the hundreds of introduced species that are accumulating in coastal systems could result in the rapid transformation of previously benign introductions into aggressively expanding invasions. Even if future management efforts reduce the number of new introductions, given the large number of species already present, there is a high potential for positive interactions to produce many future management problems. Given that invasional meltdown is now being documented in natural systems, I suggest that coastal systems may be closer to this threshold than currently believed."

Numerous species of Indo-pacific origin have colonized the Mediterranean in recent times, including tropical symbiont-bearing foraminifera. Among these is the species Pararotalia calcariformata. Unlike other invasive foraminifera, this species was discovered only two decades ago and is restricted to the eastern Mediterranean coast. Combining ecological, genetic and physiological observations, we attempt to explain the recent invasion of this species in the Mediterranean Sea. Using morphological and genetic data, we confirm the species attribution to P. calcariformata McCulloch 1977 and identify its symbionts as a consortium of diatom species dominated by Minutocellus polymorphus. We document photosynthetic activity of its endosymbionts using Pulse Amplitude Modulated Fluorometry and test the effects of elevated temperatures on growth rates of asexual offspring. The culturing of asexual offspring for 120 days shows a 30-day period of rapid growth followed by a period of slower growth. A subsequent 48-day temperature sensitivity experiment indicates a similar developmental pathway and high growth rate at 28 degrees C, whereas an almost complete inhibition of growth was observed at 20 degrees C and 35 degrees C. This indicates that the offspring of this species may have lower tolerance to cold temperatures than what would be expected for species native to the Mediterranean. We expand this hypothesis by applying a Species Distribution Model (SDM) based on modern occurrences in the Mediterranean using three environmental variables: irradiance, turbidity and yearly minimum temperature. The model reproduces the observed restricted distribution and indicates that the range of the species will drastically expand westwards under future global change scenarios. We conclude that P. calcariformata established a population in the Levant because of the recent warming in the region. In line with observations from other groups of organisms, our results indicate that continued warming of the eastern Mediterranean will facilitate the invasion of more tropical marine taxa into the Mediterranean, disturbing local biodiversity and ecosystem structure."

For example, the enemy release' hypothesis posits that introduced species become invasive because they escape topdown regulation by natural enemies while the invasional meltdown' hypothesis posits that invasions may be facilitated by synergistic interactions between introduced species. Here, we explore how facilitation and enemy release interact to moderate the potential effect of a large category of positive interactions protection mutualisms. We use the interactions between an introduced plant (Japanese knotweed Fallopia japonica), an introduced herbivore (Japanese beetle Popillia japonica), an introduced ant (European red ant Myrmica rubra), and native ants and herbivores in riparian zones of the northeastern United States as a model system. Japanese knotweed produces sugary extrafloral nectar that is attractive to ants, and we show that both sugar reward production and ant attendance increase when plants experience a level of leaf damage that is typical in the plants' native range. Using manipulative experiments at six sites, we demonstrate low levels of ant patrolling, little effect of ants on herbivory rates, and low herbivore pressure during midsummer. Herbivory rates and the capacity of ants to protect plants (as evidenced by effects of ant exclusion) increased significantly when plants were exposed to introduced Japanese beetles that attack plants in the late summer. Beetles were also associated with greater on-plant foraging by ants, and among-plant differences in ant-foraging were correlated with the magnitude of damage inflicted on plants by the beetles. Last, we found that sites occupied by introduced M. rubra ants almost invariably included Japanese knotweed. Thus, underlying variation in the spatiotemporal distribution of the introduced herbivore influences the provision of benefits to the introduced plant and to the introduced ant. More specifically, the presence of the introduced herbivore converts an otherwise weak interaction between two introduced species into a reciprocally beneficial mutualism. Because the prospects for facilitation are linked to the prospects for enemy release in protection mutualisms, species introductions can have complex effects on existing species interactions, between both native and introduced species."

Despite progress in unravelling the determinants of invasiveness and invasibility, robust, spatially-explicit predictive models for explaining real-world invasion dynamics remain illusive. Reconstructing invasion episodes is a useful way of determining the roles of different factors in mediating spread and proliferation. In many cases, however, human-aided dispersal and other anthropogenic factors blur the roles of natural controlling factors. We describe the reconstruction of an isolated invasion event from a known source: the 50-year invasion history of Opuntia stricta in the Kruger National Park. Our aim was to explore the relative roles of environment and propagule supply in shaping the invasion pattern. Environmental variables (landscape heterogeneity and distance from water sources) were moderately useful for explaining the presence/absence of O. stricta in 1-ha cells across the 660 km(2) (53% of cells correctly classified). Adding fire frequency increased the accuracy of the model (68%). However, when we considered the role of propagule pressure (measured as the distance of sites from the known primary invasion focus and putative secondary invasion foci), model accuracy was greatly improved (77%). No environmental variables or propagule pressure correctly explained spatial variation in abundance (expressed as cladode density in 1-ha cells). We discuss implications of the importance of propagule supply for modelling and managing invasions."

Small pilot studies were performed on Santa Cruz Island (SCI), California, in the early 1990s to test the efficacy of different methods on the control of Foeniculum vulgare (fennel) and management's effects on native species recovery. We chose a treatment that showed significant native species recovery, applied it at the landscape scale, and followed its effects on fennel infested plant communities. We tested the hypothesis that results from small-scale studies translate to the landscape level. We found that although the control of fennel translated from the small to landscape scale, decreasing from an average of 60% to less than 3% cover, native species recovery did not occur in the landscape study as it did in the pilot studies. Invasive fennel cover was replaced by non-native grass cover over time. Unexpectedly, fennel cover in untreated fennel plots decreased significantly (though not as drastically) from over 60% cover to just under 40% cover while native species richness in untreated areas increased significantly. The correlation between precipitation and changes in native and non-native species richness and abundance in this study imply that changes in species abundances were highly correlated with environmental fluctuations. The lack of a native seed bank and the accumulation of non-native grass litter likely prevented the recovery of native species in treated areas. Greater vertical complexity found in fennel communities, which increased visitation by frugivorous birds and likely increased native seed dispersal, may have been responsible for the increase in native species richness in the untreated areas. These results suggest that successful invasive species control and native species recovery experiments conducted at small scales may not translate to the landscape level, and active restoration should be an organic component of such large-scale projects.

Moreover, because geographic ranges span a diversity of environments, the outcome of interactions between species pairs may vary spatially. The European green crab Carcinus maenas and the Asian shore crab Hemigrapsus sanguineus are both introduced species in North America where they co-occur over a large portion of the Atlantic coast. While interactions between the two crabs in the southern portion of this range within Long Island Sound resulted in the elimination of C maenas within 2-3 years of H. sanguineus' arrival. species replacement appears to be taking much longer in northern areas within the Gulf of Maine. Previous work implicates predation by H. sanguineus on C. maenas recruits as the mechanism underlying species replacement. Here we explore an alternative or additional mechanism underlying this species replacement that can also account for the observed spatial variation in the timescale of species replacement between northern and southern areas. Specifically, we demonstrate that a previously documented shift in C. maenas diet which occurs in the presence of H. sanguineus can cause a reduction in C. maenas fecundity. This, combined with near-shore current patterns may explain the regional differences in the outcome of this species interaction. (C) 2011 Elsevier By. All rights reserved."

Here, we tested the ER hypothesis on the South African species Senecio pterophorus (Asteraceae), which is native to the Eastern Cape, has expanded into the Western Cape, and was introduced into Australia (> 70-100 years ago) and Europe (> 30 years ago). Insect seed predation was evaluated to determine whether plants in the introduced areas were released from herbivores compared to plants from the native range. In South Africa, 25 % of the seedheads of sampled plants were damaged. Plants from the introduced populations suffered lower seed predation compared to those from the native populations, as expected under the ER hypothesis, and this release was more pronounced in the region with the most recent introduction (Europe 0.2 % vs. Australia 15 %). The insect communities feeding on S. pterophorus in Australia and Europe differed from those found in South Africa, suggesting that the plants were released from their associated fauna after invasion and later established new associations with local herbivore communities in the novel habitats. Our study is the first to provide strong evidence of enemy release in a biogeographical survey across the entire known distribution of a species."

However, as invading hosts and parasites may be derived from a small subset of genotypes in the native range, it is important to examine the distribution and invasion of parasites in the context of host population genetics. We demonstrate that invasive European populations of the North American Crangonyx pseudogracilis have experienced a reduction in post-invasion genetic diversity. We predict that vertically transmitted parasites may evade the stochastic processes and selective pressures leading to enemy release. As microsporidia may be vertically or horizontally transmitted, we compared the diversity of these microparasites in the native and invasive ranges of the host. In contrast to the reduction in host genetic diversity, we find no evidence for enemy release from microsporidian parasites in the invasive populations. Indeed, a single, vertically transmitted, microsporidian sex ratio distorter dominates the microsporidian parasite assemblage in the invasive range and appears to have invaded with the host. We propose that overproduction of female offspring as a result of parasitic sex ratio distortion may facilitate host invasion success. We also propose that a selective sweep resulting from the increase in infected individuals during the establishment may have contributed to the reduction in genetic diversity in invasive Crangonyx pseudogracilis populations."

B.K. Simon & S.W.L. Jacobs - Poaceae) is an invasive C4 grass that known to slow ecological succession in restoration sites. This study aimed to evaluate the responses of the woody species and M. maximus itself to manual removal in a 20-year-old reforestation site. Forty-five 5 x 5-m plots were established in 2008 and evaluated until 2012. The plots were divided into three treatments: control (CON), manual removal for one year (MR1), and manual removal for two years (MR2). All individuals of woody species >10 cm were sampled. Canopy cover, grass cover, and the number of seedlings of M. maximus were also recorded. After the first weeding, M. maximus seedlings were manually uprooted every four months, for a total of three times in MR1 (2008-2009) and six times in MR2 (2008-2010). After the manual removal was stopped, the seedlings of M. maximus were counted and were allowed to grow in order to assess its reestablishment potential. The number of new grass seedlings decreased drastically after the first year with repeated removals and did not differ between removal treatments at any time, even after removals halted, indicating that one year of removal was sufficient to displace the grass. With the exclusion of Guinea-grass, an increase in the abundance and richness of other exotic species was observed until the second year. However, the increase in canopy cover during the four years likely benefited native woody species and impaired M. maximus and other exotics. In addition, after four years, although the woody species richness did not differ between the three treatments, the total abundance and pioneer species richness were higher in both removal treatments. These findings suggest that the grass slows ecological succession. However, both the increase in canopy cover and decrease in grass cover indicate that, in the absence of fire, native vegetation will suppress Guineagrass. Furthermore, grass removal from the understory of early secondary forests and reforestations can be used to accelerate succession, reducing both fire risk and failures of ecological restoration initiatives.

In addition, these human-caused disturbances occur mostly in lowlands producing greater fragmentation and degradation there than in higher elevations. Plant invasion should be greater in more fragmented and degraded forests and hence lowlands should be more invaded than higher elevations. In turn, native species richness should be negatively related to fragmentation and degradation and hence greater in higher elevations within a forest type or elevation belt. We assessed these hypotheses in an Andean temperate forest of southern Chile, Araucania Region. We recorded the vascular plant composition in twelve fragments of different size, perimeter/area, elevation level and evidence of human degradation (loping, fire, cattle faeces). Based on these variables we performed a fragmentation and a degradation index. Pearson correlations were used to analyze the relationship between all these variables. We found that fragmentation and degradation were positively correlated, and each of them decreased with altitude. Furthermore, fragmentation and degradation affected native and exotic species richness in different ways. Invasion was enhanced by both fragmentation and degradation, and as consequence of the altitudinal patterns of these human-caused disturbances, invasion seems to occur mainly in lowlands. In turn, native species richness decreased with fragmentation, and it was not related to degradation nor altitude."

The birds facilitated seed germination by removing the pulp of fruit: the final per cent germination (FG) of cleaned seeds was higher than those within the fruit for three of the four plant species and in some cases passage through birds significantly increased FG (Schinus terebinthifolius) or Coefficient of Velocity (CV) (Lantana camara)."

This study aimed, for the first time, to address the importance of propagule pressure and disturbance by examining the spread of an introduced tree, Cordia alliodora, from a single plantation into a surrounding mosaic of humid forest in the East Usambara Mountains, Tanzania. By assessing vulnerability to invasion along transects radiating from the plantation, the effects of distance (measure of propagule pressure), and disturbance could be discerned. For all life stages, distance from source population was the strongest correlate of density. A marked influence of disturbance was only evident for C. alliodora seedlings. Spatial variation in the densities of later life stages may be a function of past disturbances, less easy to assess from current surveys, especially following the marked self-thinning between seedling and adult densities. Nevertheless, the evidence suggests that propagule pressure is a more important determinant of Cordia density than disturbance. If this is true for other alien tree species in tropical forests, controlling for introduction effort is essential to assess the drivers of plant invasion. Given an annual population growth rate of ca 3.5 percent, equivalent to the population doubling every 20 yr, C. alliodora poses a significant threat to the East Usambaras as well as other humid forests where it is promoted for agroforestry."

During the last centuries many alien species have established and spread in new regions, where some of them cause large ecological and economic problems. As one of the main explanations of the spread of alien species, the enemy-release hypothesis is widely accepted and frequently serves as justification for biological control. 2. We used a global fungus-plant host distribution data set for 140 North American plant species naturalized in Europe to test whether alien plants are generally released from foliar and floral pathogens, whether they are mainly released from pathogens that are rare in the native range, and whether geographic spread of the North American plant species in Europe is associated with release from fungal pathogens. 3. We show that the 140 North American plant species naturalized in Europe were released from 58% of their foliar and floral fungal pathogen species. However, when we also consider fungal pathogens of the native North American host range that in Europe so far have only been reported on other plant species, the estimated release is reduced to 10.3%. Moreover, in Europe North American plants have mainly escaped their rare, pathogens, of which the impact is restricted to few populations. Most importantly and directly opposing the enemy-release hypothesis, geographic spread of the alien plants in Europe was negatively associated with their release from fungal pathogens. 4. Synthesis. North American plants may have escaped particular fungal species that control them in their native range, but based on total loads of fungal species, release from foliar and floral fungal pathogens does not explain the geographic spread of North American plant species in Europe. To test whether enemy release is the major driver of plant invasiveness, we urgently require more studies comparing release of invasive and non-invasive alien species from enemies of different guilds, and studies that assess the actual impact of the enemies."

Algal species with a circumtropical distribution did not show a similar effect of herbivores on their growth. Nutrient enrichment did not enhance growth of any algal species in either region. The reduction in herbivore intensity experienced by invasive algae in Hawaii rather than an escape from (native) herbivores provided invasive macroalgae with ""enemy release"" sensu the Enemy Release Hypothesis (ERH). Since native, Hawaiian herbivores still feed and even prefer invasive algae over native species, invasion scenario's that involve predation (e.g. the ERH) could be falsely dismissed when invasive species are only studied in their invasive range. We therefore argue that escape from herbivores (i.e. enemy release) can only effectively be determined with additional information on the intensity of predation experienced by an invasive species in its native range."

Therefore the enemy release hypothesis (ERH) and biotic resistance hypothesis (BRH) were examined in relation to the invasiveness of the introduced dune grass Ammophila arenaria in South Africa. To compare plant-soil feedback from the native habitat in Europe and the new habitat in South Africa, plants were grown in their own soil from both Europe and South Africa, as well as in sterilised and non-sterilised soils from a number of indigenous South African foredune plant species. While the soil feedback of most plant species supports the ERH, the feedback from Sporobolus virginicus soil demonstrates that this plant species may contribute to biotic resistance against the introduced A. arenaria, through negative feedback from the soil community. Not only the local plant species diversity, but also the type of plant species present seemed to be important in determining the potential for biotic resistance. As a result, biotic resistance against invasive plant species may depend not only on plant competition, but also on the presence of plant species that are hosts of potential soil pathogens that may negatively affect the invaders. In conclusion, exotic plant species such as A. arenaria in South Africa that do not become highly invasive, may experience the ERH and BRH simultaneously, with the balance between enemy escape versus biotic resistance determining the invasiveness of a species in a new habitat."

This dominance is often thought to be a result of release from specialist enemies in the invaded range, or the evolution of increased competitive ability. Soil borne microorganisms have often been overlooked as enemies in this context, but a less deleterious plant soil interaction in the invaded range could explain local dominance. Two plant species, Carpobrotus edulis and the hybrid Carpobrotus X cf. acinaciformis, are considered major pests in the Mediterranean basin. We tested if release from soil-borne enemies and/or evolution of increased competitive ability could explain this dominance. Comparing biomass production in non-sterile soil with that in sterilized soil, we found that inoculation with rhizosphere soil from the native range reduced biomass production by 32% while inoculation with rhizosphere soil from the invaded range did not have a significant effect on plant biomass. Genotypes from the invaded range, including a hybrid, did not perform better than plants from the native range in sterile soil. Hence evolution of increased competitive ability and hybridization do not seem to play a major role. We conclude that the reduced negative net impact of the soil community in the invaded range may contribute to the success of Carpobrotus species in the Mediterranean basin. (C) 2008 SAAB.

The enemy release hypothesis argues that invaders' impacts result from reduced natural enemy attack(2,4,6-10). The biotic resistance hypothesis argues that interactions with native species, including natural enemies, limit invaders' impacts(6-8). We tested these hypotheses for viruses and for rust, smut and powdery mildew fungi that infect 473 plant species naturalized to the United States from Europe. On average, 84% fewer fungi and 24% fewer virus species infect each plant species in its naturalized range than in its native range. In addition, invasive plant species that are more completely released from pathogens are more widely reported as harmful invaders of both agricultural and natural ecosystems. Together, these results strongly support the enemy release hypothesis. Among noxious agricultural weeds, species accumulating more pathogens in their naturalized range are less widely noxious, supporting the biotic resistance hypothesis. Our results indicate that invasive plants' impacts may be a function of both release from and accumulation of natural enemies, including pathogens."

Assessment of impacted and control sites before and after ungulate exclusion using airborne imaging spectroscopy and LiDAR, time series satellite observations, and ground-based field studies over nine years indicated that removal of generalist herbivores facilitated exotic success, but the abundance of native species was unchanged. Vegetation cover,1 m in height increased in ungulate-free areas from 48.7% +/- 1.5% to 74.3% +/- 1.8% over 8.4 years, corresponding to an annualized growth rate of lambda = 1.05 +/- 0.01 yr(-1) (median +/- SD). Most of the change was attributable to exotic plant species, which increased from 24.4% +/- 1.4% to 49.1% +/- 2.0%, (lambda = 1.08 +/- 0.01 yr(-1)). Native plants experienced no significant change in cover (23.0% +/- 1.3% to 24.2% +/- 1.8%, lambda = 1.01 +/- 0.01 yr(-1)). Time series of satellite phenology were indistinguishable between the treatment and a 3.0-km(2) control site for four years prior to ungulate removal, but they diverged immediately following exclusion of ungulates. Comparison of monthly EVI means before and after ungulate exclusion and between the managed and control areas indicates that EVI strongly increased in the managed area after ungulate exclusion. Field studies and airborne analyses show that the dominant invader was Senecio madagascariensis, an invasive annual forb that increased from <0.01% to 14.7% fractional cover in ungulate-free areas (lambda -1.89 +/- 0.34 yr(-1)), but which was nearly absent from the control site. A combination of canopy LAI, water, and fractional cover were expressed in satellite EVI time series and indicate that the invaded region maintained greenness during drought conditions. These findings demonstrate that enemy release from generalist herbivores can facilitate exotic success and suggest a plausible mechanism by which invasion occurred. They also show how novel remote-sensing technology can be integrated with conservation and management to help address exotic plant invasions."

Here, we suggest using the knowledge of exotic facilitations to control invasive earthworm populations. In northern hardwood forests, the invasive shrubs Rhamnus cathartica (buckthorn) and Lonicera x bella (honeysuckle) produce high quality leaf litter, and their abundance is positively correlated with exotic earthworms, which increase nutrient cycling rates. We performed an invasive plant removal experiment in two northern hardwood forest stands, one dominated by buckthorn and the other by honeysuckle. Removal of invasive shrubs reduced exotic earthworm populations by roughly 50% for the following 3 years. By targeting invasive species that are part of positive feedback loops, land managers can multiply the positive effects of invasive species removal."

The earthworm communities and soil properties were compared between sites with privet, privet removal sites, and reference sites where privet had never established. Results showed that introduced European earthworms (Aporrectodea caliginosa, Lumbricus rubellus, and Octolasion tyrtaeum) were more prevalent under privet cover, and privet removal reduced their relative abundance (from >90% to similar to 70%) in the community. Conversely, the relative abundance of native species (Diplocardia michaelsenii) increased fourfold with privet removal and was highest in reference sites. Soils under privet were characterized by significantly higher pH relative to reference plots and privet removal facilitated a significant reduction in pH. These results suggest that privet-mediated effects on soil pH may confer a competitive advantage to European lumbricid earthworms. Furthermore, removal of the invasive shrub appears to reverse the changes in soil pH, and may allow for recovery of native earthworm fauna. Published by Elsevier B.V."

Within these areas, we sampled vegetation in 5 x 5 m plots for stems 2 cm DBH (diameter at breast height) or greater and in 2 x 0.5 m plots for stems of all sizes. For five years, at annual censuses, we ragged and measured stems of vines, trees, shrubs and herbs in these plots. For each 5 x 5 m plot, we estimated percent coverage by individual vine species, using native and nonnative vines as classes. We investigated the hypotheses that: (1) plot coverage, occurrence and recruitment of nonnative vines were greater than mat of native vines in unmanaged pion; (2) the management program was effective at reducing cover by nonnative vines; and (3) reduction of cover by nonnative vines improved recruitment of seedlings and saplings of native trees, shrubs,and herbs. In unmanaged plots, nonnative vines recruited more seedlings and had a significantly higher plot-cover index, but not a higher frequency of occurrence. Management significantly reduced cover by nonnative vines and had a significant overall positive effect on recruitment of seedlings and saplings of native trees, shrubs and herbs. Management also affected the seedling community (which included vines, trees, shrubs, and herbs) in some unanticipated ways, favoring early successional species for a longer period of time. The vine species with the greatest potential to ""strangle"" gaps rapidly formed dense cover, had shade tolerant seedling recruitment, and were animal-dispersed This suite of traits was more common in the nonnative vines than in the native vines. Our results suggest chat some vines may alter the spatiotemporal pattern of recruitment sites in a forest ecosystem following a natural disturbance by creating many very shady spots very quickly."

Within these areas, we sampled vegetation in 5 x 5 m plots for stems 2 cm DBH (diameter at breast height) or greater and in 2 x 0.5 m plots for stems of all sizes. For five years, at annual censuses, we ragged and measured stems of vines, trees, shrubs and herbs in these plots. For each 5 x 5 m plot, we estimated percent coverage by individual vine species, using native and nonnative vines as classes. We investigated the hypotheses that: (1) plot coverage, occurrence and recruitment of nonnative vines were greater than mat of native vines in unmanaged pion; (2) the management program was effective at reducing cover by nonnative vines; and (3) reduction of cover by nonnative vines improved recruitment of seedlings and saplings of native trees, shrubs,and herbs. In unmanaged plots, nonnative vines recruited more seedlings and had a significantly higher plot-cover index, but not a higher frequency of occurrence. Management significantly reduced cover by nonnative vines and had a significant overall positive effect on recruitment of seedlings and saplings of native trees, shrubs and herbs. Management also affected the seedling community (which included vines, trees, shrubs, and herbs) in some unanticipated ways, favoring early successional species for a longer period of time. The vine species with the greatest potential to ""strangle"" gaps rapidly formed dense cover, had shade tolerant seedling recruitment, and were animal-dispersed This suite of traits was more common in the nonnative vines than in the native vines. Our results suggest chat some vines may alter the spatiotemporal pattern of recruitment sites in a forest ecosystem following a natural disturbance by creating many very shady spots very quickly."

Subsequently, another nonnative salmonid species, S. trutta have expanded the Chitose River system since the early 1980s. At present, S. trutta have replaced O. mykiss in the majority of the Chitose River, although O. mykiss have persisted in areas above migration barriers that prevent S. trutta expansion.

Only in the last two decades has the species become naturalized and invasive in some parts of its new range, notably in semi-arid savannas. Research is being undertaken to predict its potential for further invasion in South Africa. We studied production, dispersal and predation of seeds, seed banks, and seedling establishment in relation to land uses at three sites, namely ungrazed savanna once used as a military training ground; a savanna grazed by native game; and an ungrazed mine dump. We found that seed production and seed rain density of S. molle varied greatly between study sites, but was high at all sites (384 864-1 233 690 seeds per tree per year; 3877-9477 seeds per square metre per year). We found seeds dispersed to distances of up to 320 m from female trees, and most seeds were deposited within 50 m of putative source trees. Annual seed rain density below canopies of Acacia tortillis, the dominant native tree at all sites, was significantly lower in grazed savanna. The quality of seed rain was much reduced by endophagous predators. Seed survival in the soil was low, with no survival recorded beyond 1 year. Propagule pressure to drive the rate of recruitment: densities of seedlings and sapling densities were higher in ungrazed savanna and the ungrazed mine dump than in grazed savanna, as reflected by large numbers of young individuals, but adult : seedling ratios did not differ between savanna sites. Frequent and abundant seed production, together with effective dispersal of viable S. molle seed by birds to suitable establishment sites below trees of other species to overcome predation effects, facilitates invasion. Disturbance enhances invasion, probably by reducing competition from native plants."

We assess the current status of plant invasion in Galapagos, predict the likelihood of future naturalizations and invasions from the existing introduced flora, and suggest measures to help limit future invasions. There has been a 1.46 fold increase in plant biodiversity in Galapagos due to alien plant naturalizations, reflecting a similar trend on islands elsewhere. There are 870 alien plant species recorded in the archipelago. Of evaluated species, 34% species have naturalized. Within this group are the invasive species (16% of evaluated) and the transformers (3.3% of evaluated). We show that, as expected, naturalized species have been present in the archipelago longer than non-naturalized species. We also find that a higher human-mediated propagule pressure is associated with a greater human population and with properties that have been settled longer. This, combined with the relatively recent introduction of most species, leads us to the conclusion that Galapagos is at an early stage of plant invasion. We predict that more species from the existing alien flora will find an opportunity to naturalize and invade as propagule pressure increases alongside rapid human population growth associated with immigration to serve the booming tourism industry. In order to reduce future invasion risk, we suggest reviewing inter-island quarantine measures and continuing community education efforts to reduce human-mediated propagule pressure."

Here we provide field evidence that trematode parasites are absent in a highly invasive morph of the gastropod Melanoides tuberculata in Lake Malawi, and that the invasive morph is resistant to indigenous trematodes that castrate and induce gigantism in native M. tuberculata. Since helminth infections can strongly influence host population abundances in other host-parasite systems, this enemy release may have provided an advantage to the invasive morph in terms of reproductive capacity and survivorship."

Removal treatments included (1) everything, (2) shrubs, (3) perennial grasses, (4) taprooted forbs, (5) rhizomatous forbs, (6) annual forbs, and (7) mosses. A control where nothing was removed was also established. Plots were arranged in a randomized complete block with 4 replications (blocks) at each site. Functional groups were removed beginning in the spring of 2004 and maintained monthly throughout each growing season through 2009. Medusahead was seeded at a rate of 2,000 seeds m(-2) (186 seeds ft(-2)) in fall 2005. Removing perennial grasses nearly doubled medusahead density and biomass compared with any other removal treatment. The second highest density and biomass of medusahead occurred from removing rhizomatous forbs (phlox). We found perennial grasses played a relatively more significant role than other species in minimizing invasion by medusahead. We suggest that the most effective basis for establishing medusahead-resistant plant communities is to establish 2 or 3 highly productive grasses that are complementary in niche and that overlap that of the invading species."

We used 13-year-old deer exclosures in Great Smoky Mountains National Park, USA, to examine how chronic disturbance by deer browsing affects available resources, plant diversity, and invasion in an understory plant community. Using two replicate 1 m(2) plots in each deer browsed and unbrowsed area, we recorded each plant species present, the abundance per species, and the fractional percent cover of vegetation by the cover classes: herbaceous, woody, and graminoid. For each sample plot, we also estimated overstory canopy cover, soil moisture, total soil carbon and nitrogen, and soil pH as a measure of abiotic differences between plots. We found that plant community composition between chronically browsed and unbrowsed plots differed markedly. Plant diversity was 40% lower in browsed than in unbrowsed plots. At our sites, diversity explained 48% and woody plant cover 35% of the variation in M. vimineum abundance. In addition, we found 3.3 times less M. vimineum in the unbrowsed plots due to higher woody plant cover and plant diversity than in the browsed plots. A parsimonious explanation of these results indicate that disturbances such as herbivory may elicit multiple conditions, namely releasing available resources such as open space, light, and decreasing plant diversity, which may facilitate the proliferation of an invasive species. Finally, by testing two different hypotheses, this study addresses more recent calls to incorporate multiple hypotheses into research attempting to explain plant invasion."

Although many studies have addressed the effects of exotic plants on the communities they invade, few have quantified the effects of invader removal on plant communities, or considered the degree to which different plant groups vary in response to invasion and invader removal. We evaluated the effects of an exotic succulent, iceplant (Carpobrotus edulis), on a coastal dune plant community in northern California, as well as the community responses to its removal. To assess possible mechanisms by which iceplant affects other plants, we also evaluated its above- and belowground influences on the germination and growth of a dominant exotic annual grass, Bromus diandrus. We found that iceplant invasion was associated with reduced native plant cover as well as increased cover and density of some exotic plants-especially exotic annual grasses. However, iceplant removal did not necessarily lead to a reversal of these effects: removal increased the cover and density of both native and exotic species. We also found that B. diandrus grown in iceplant patches, or in soil where iceplant had been removed, had poorer germination and growth than B. diandrus grown in soil not influenced by iceplant. This suggests that the influence of iceplant on this dune plant community occurs, at least in part, due to belowground effects, and that these effects remain after iceplant has been removed. Our study demonstrates the importance of considering how exotic invasive plants affect not only native species, but also co-occurring exotic taxa. It also shows that combining observational studies with removal experiments can lead to important insights into the influence of invaders and the mechanisms of their effects."

Major constraints for grassland restoration are high soil fertility and limited dispersal ability of plant species to target sites. Usually, studies focus on soil fertility or on methods to introduce plant seeds. However, the question is whether soil fertility reduction is always necessary for getting plant species established on target sites. In a three-year field experiment with ex-arable soil with intensive farming history, we tested single and combined effects of soil fertility reduction and sowing mid-successional plant species on plant community development and soil biological properties. A controlled microcosm study was performed to test short-term effects of soil fertility reduction measures on biomass production of mid-successional species. Soil fertility was manipulated by adding carbon (wood or straw) to incorporate plant-available nutrients into organic matter, or by removing nutrients through top soil removal (TSR). The sown species established successfully and their establishment was independent of carbon amendments. TSR reduced plant biomass, and effectively suppressed arable weeds, however, created a desert-like environment, inhibiting the effectiveness of sowing mid-successional plant species. Adding straw or wood resulted in short-term reduction of plant biomass, suggesting a temporal decrease in plant-available nutrients by microbial immobilisation. Straw and wood addition had little effects on soil biological properties, whereas TSR profoundly reduced numbers of bacteria, fungal biomass and nematode abundance. In conclusion, in ex-arable soils, on a short-term sowing is more effective for grassland restoration than strategies aiming at soil fertility reduction. Published by Elsevier Ltd."

Location An invaded coastal dune ecosystem in Portugal and reference bradyrhizobial strains from the Iberian Peninsula and other locations. Methods Symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria were isolated from root nodules of plants of the Australian invasive Acacia longifolia and the European natives Cytisus grandiflorus, Cytisus scoparius and Ulex europaeus. Total DNA of each isolate was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with the primer BOX A1R. Subsequent PCR-sequencing and phylogenetic analyses of the internal transcribed spacer region and the nifD and nodA genes were performed for all different strains. Results The four plant species analysed were nodulated by bacteria from three different Bradyrhizobium lineages, although most of the isolates belonged to the Bradyrhizobium japonicum lineage sensu lato. Ninety-five per cent of the bradyrhizobia isolated from A. longifolia, C. grandiflorus and U. europaeus in the invaded ecosystem had nifD and nodA genes of Australian origin. Seven isolates obtained in this study define a new distinctive nifD group of Bradyrhizobium from western and Mediterranean Europe. Main conclusions These results reveal the introduction of exotic bacteria with the invasive plant species, their persistence in the new geographical area and the nodulation of native legumes by rhizobia containing exotic symbiotic genes. The disruption of native mutualisms and the mutual facilitation of the invasive spread of the introduced plant and bradyrhizobia could constitute the first report of an invasional meltdown documented for a plant-bacteria mutualism."

We sampled presence and cover of aliens in 20 plots (6 25m) per road at 5-km intervals for four roads, nested within three localities around cities (n=240).

Nevertheless, the precise mechanisms facilitating this expansion are rarely known. We tested the hypothesis that dirt roads are favorable landing and nest initiation sites for founding-queens of the leaf-cutter ant Atta laevigata. For 2 yr, we compared the number of attempts to found new nests (colonization attempts) in dirt roads and the adjacent vegetation in a reserve of cerrado (tree-dominated savanna) in southeastern Brazil. The number of colonization attempts in roads was 5 to 10 times greater than in the adjacent vegetation. Experimental transplants indicate that founding-queens are more likely to establish a nest on bare soil than on soil covered with leaf-litter, but the amount of litter covering the ground did not fully explain the preference of queens for dirt roads. Queens that landed on roads were at higher risk of predation by beetles and ants than those that landed in the adjacent vegetation. Nevertheless, greater predation in roads was not sufficient to offset the greater number of colonization attempts in this habitat. As a consequence, significantly more new colonies were established in roads than in the adjacent vegetation. Our results suggest that disturbance caused by the opening of roads could result in an increased Atta abundance in protected areas of the Brazilian Cerrado."

Lam. on native and exotic species cover in two Great Plains ecosystems in Badlands National Park, South Dakota. Melilotus is still widely planted and its effects on native ecosystems are not well studied. Melilotus could have direct effects on native plants, such as through competition or facilitation. Alternatively, Melilotus may have indirect effects on natives, e. g., by favoring exotic species which in turn have a negative effect on native species. This study examined these interactions across a 4-year period in two contrasting vegetation types: Badlands sparse vegetation and western wheatgrass (Pascopyrum smithii) mixed-grass prairie. Structural equation models were used to analyze the pathways through which Melilotus, native species, and other exotic species interact over a series of 2-year time steps. Melilotus can affect native and exotic species both in the current year and in the years after its death (a lag effect). A lag effect is possible because the death of a Melilotus plant can leave an open, potentially nitrogen-enriched site on the landscape. The results showed that the relationship between Melilotus and native and exotic species varied depending on the habitat and the year. In Badlands sparse vegetation, there was a consistent, strong, and positive relationship between Melilotus cover and native and exotic species cover suggesting that Melilotus is acting as a nurse plant and facilitating the growth of other species. In contrast, in western wheatgrass prairie, Melilotus was acting as a weak competitor and had no consistent effect on other species. In both habitats, there was little evidence for a direct lag effect of Melilotus on other species. Together, these results suggest both facilitative and competitive roles for Melilotus, depending on the vegetation type it invades."

More individuals enhance colonization success because they aid in overcoming demographic consequences of small population size (e.g. stochasticity and Allee effects). The number of founders can also have direct genetic effects: with fewer individuals, more inbreeding and thus inbreeding depression will occur, whereas more individuals typically harbour greater genetic variation. Thus, the demographic and genetic components of propagule pressure are interrelated, making it difficult to understand which mechanisms are most important in determining colonization success. We experimentally disentangled the demographic and genetic components of propagule pressure by manipulating the number of founders (fewer or more), and genetic background (inbred or outbred) of individuals released in a series of three complementary experiments. We used Bemisia whiteflies and released them onto either their natal host (benign) or a novel host (challenging). Our experiments revealed that having more founding individuals and those individuals being outbred both increased the number of adults produced, but that only genetic background consistently shaped net reproductive rate of experimental populations. Environment was also important and interacted with propagule size to determine the number of adults produced. Quality of the environment interacted also with genetic background to determine establishment success, with a more pronounced effect of inbreeding depression in harsh environments. This interaction did not hold for the net reproductive rate. These data show that the positive effect of propagule pressure on founding success can be driven as much by underlying genetic processes as by demographics. Genetic effects can be immediate and have sizable effects on fitness."

We used experimental colonies of the invasive Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) that differed both in worker and queen number to test how these attributes influence the survivorship and growth of incipient colonies. All propagules without workers experienced queen mortality, in contrast to only 6% of propagules with workers. In small propagules (10-1,000 workers), brood production increased with worker number but not queen number. In contrast, per capita measures of colony growth decreased with worker number over these colony sizes. In larger propagules (1,000-11,000 workers), brood production also increased with increasing worker number, but per capita brood production appeared independent of colony size. Our results suggest that queens need workers to establish successfully but that propagules with as few as 10 workers can grow quickly. Given the requirements for propagule success in Argentine ants, it is not surprising how easily they spread via human commerce."

Using a factorial experiment, nutrient availability and intensity of herbivory were manipulated along an intertidal rocky shore. We found that early recruitment of S. muticum was enhanced by low nutrient enrichment but no effect of grazers was observed. In contrast, at the end of the experiment (9-months after invasion) top-down control, together with the number of NIS and the percentage cover of ephemerals, was a significant predictor for the invasion success of S. muticum. In addition, both top-down and bottom-up forces played a significant role in structuring macroalgal assemblages, which indirectly could have influenced invasion success.

Invasion of exotic species into highly saturated communities has been demonstrated to be, on average, less probable than their invasion into unsaturated communities. A hypothesis explaining the relationship between these parameters has been put forward. According to the hypothesis, the number of alien species in a specific locality in a community is determined by their ratio to the number of native species in the species pools of these communities; and their mean abundance, by the ratio of the total number of species to the number of individuals in the localities. Both ratios are smaller in saturated biocenoses, which determines a relatively small admixture of alien species in them."

Furthermore, the relationship between native and alien species richness became increasingly positive and significant from the plant neighbourhood scale (1-m2) to the 10-m2, 100-m2, and the 1000-m2 scale where over 80% of the vegetation types had positive slopes between native and alien species richness. Both native and alien plant species may be responding to increased resource availability and/or habitat heterogeneity with increased area. We found significant positive relationships between the coefficient of variation of native cover in 1-m2 subplots in a vegetation type (i.e. a measure of habitat heterogeneity), and both the relative cover and relative biomass of alien plant species. At the 1000-m2 scale, we did find weak negative relationships between native species richness and the cover, biomass, and relative cover of alien plant species. However, we found very strong positive relationships between alien species richness and the cover, relative cover, and relative biomass of alien species at regional scales. These results, along with many other field studies in natural ecosystems, show that the dominant genera pattern in invasion ecology at multiple spatial scales is one of ""biotic acceptance"" where natural ecosystems tend to accommodate the establishment and coexistence of introduced species despite the presence and abundance of native species."

While the scale dependence of diversity estimation has received substantial attention, the scale dependence of disturbance estimation has been essentially overlooked. Here, we break from conventional examination of the diversity-disturbance relationship by holding the area over which species richness is estimated constant and instead manipulating the area over which human disturbance is measured. In the boreal forest ecoregion of Alberta, Canada, we test the dependence of species richness on disturbance scale, the scale-dependence of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, and the consistency of these patterns in native versus exotic species and among human disturbance types. We related field observed species richness in 1 ha surveys of 372 boreal vascular plant communities to remotely sensed measures of human disturbance extent at two survey scales: local (1 ha) and landscape (18 km(2)). Supporting the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, species richness-disturbance relationships were quadratic at both local and landscape scales of disturbance measurement. This suggests the shape of richness-disturbance relationships is independent of the scale at which disturbance is assessed, despite that local diversity is influenced by disturbance at different scales by different mechanisms, such as direct removal of individuals (local) or indirect alteration of propagule supply (landscape). By contrast, predictions of species richness did depend on scale of disturbance measurement: with high local disturbance richness was double that under high landscape disturbance."

Interactions with invasive species represent an increasingly common source of stressor in many habitats. However, due to the increasing abundance of invasive species around the globe, invasive species now commonly cause stresses not only for native species in invaded areas, but also for other invasive species. I examine the European green crab Carcinus maenas, an invasive species along the northeast coast of North America, which is known to be negatively impacted in this invaded region by interactions with the invasive Asian shore crab Hemigrapsus sanguineus. Asian shore crabs are known to negatively impact green crabs via two mechanisms: by directly preying on green crab juveniles and by indirectly reducing green crab fecundity via interference (and potentially exploitative) competition that alters green crab diets. I used life-table analyses to scale these two mechanistic stressors up to the population level in order to examine their relative impacts on green crab populations. I demonstrate that lost fecundity has larger impacts on per capita population growth rates, but that both predation and lost fecundity are capable of reducing population growth sufficiently to produce the declines in green crab populations that have been observed in areas where these two species overlap. By scaling up the impacts of one invader on a second invader, I have demonstrated that multiple documented interactions between these species are capable of having population-level impacts and that both may be contributing to the decline of European green crabs in their invaded range on the east coast of North America."

This species experiences seasonal constraints in activity because of cold temperatures in winter in the northern United States, but is active year-round in the south. We performed a laboratory experiment to examine how life-history traits of Ae. albopictus from four populations (New Jersey [39.4 degrees N], Virginia [38.6 degrees N], North Carolina [35.8 degrees N], Florida [27.6 degrees N]) responded to photoperiod conditions that mimic approaching winter in the north (short static daylength, short diminishing daylength) or relatively benign summer conditions in the south (long daylength), at low and high larval densities. Individuals from northern locations were predicted to exhibit reduced development times and to emerge smaller as adults under short daylength, but be larger and take longer to develop under long daylength. Life-history traits of southern populations were predicted to show less plasticity in response to daylength because of low probability of seasonal mortality in those areas. Males and females responded strongly to photoperiod regardless of geographic location, being generally larger but taking longer to develop under the long daylength compared with short day lengths; adults of both sexes were smaller when reared at low larval densities. Adults also differed in mass and development time among locations, although this effect was independent of density and photoperiod in females but interacted with density in males. Differences between male and female mass and development times was greater in the long photoperiod suggesting differences between the sexes in their reaction to different photoperiods. This work suggests that Ae. albopictus exhibits sex-specific phenotypic plasticity in life-history traits matching variation in important environmental variables."

This species has aggressive growth, competitively replacing native trees in the natural forest of the islands. The aim of this study was to examine seed and seedling factors which might confer an advantage to the establishment of Bischofia over native trees. During a 5-yr period we compared the demographic parameters of early life history of Bischofia and Elaeocarpus photiniae-folius, a native canopy dominant, in actively invaded forests. Predation of Elaeocarpus seeds by introduced rodents was much higher before (27.9-32.9%) and after (41.3-100%) dispersal of seeds than that of B. javanica. Most Elaeocarpus seeds lost viability ca. 6 mo after burial in forest soil while some seeds of Bischofia remained viable for more than 2 yr. Seedling survival in the first 2 yr was much higher in Bischofia (16%) than in Elaeocarpus (1.3%). The high persistence of Bischofia in the shade, coupled to its rapid acclimation to high light levels, is an unusual combination because in forest tree species there is generally a trade-off between seedling survival in the shade and response to canopy opening. Compared with a native canopy dominant, greater seed longevity, lower seed predation by introduced rodents, longer fruiting periods and the ability to form seedling banks under closed canopy appear to have contributed to the invasive success of Bischofia on the Bonin Islands."

Herbivores often establish a dual relationship with plants: antagonist, through herbivory, and mutualist, through seed dispersal. By consuming plants, herbivores may disperse large amounts of seeds, and can facilitate the spread of alien plants. However, seed dispersal of alien plants by herbivores has been largely uninvestigated. I studied factors associated with dispersal of alien and native seeds by the three most important vertebrate herbivores in SW Australia: emus (Dromaius novaehollandia), western grey kangaroos (Macropus fuliginosus) and European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus). Overall frequencies of alien and native seeds dispersed by these herbivores were determined by differences among them in (1) the plant groups they predominantly disperse, that differed in frequencies of aliens versus natives, and (2) the predominant dispersal of aliens or natives within those plant groups. Emus and kangaroos (natives) tended to disperse predominantly alien seeds within plant groups (defined by life forms, dispersal syndromes, and diaspore size), whereas rabbits (alien) tended to disperse predominantly natives. This agrees with the hypothesis that herbivores will use predominantly plants that have evolved in different areas, because of less effective defences against new enemies. Overall frequencies were consistent with this pattern in kangaroos and rabbits, but not in emus. Kangaroos dispersed mostly plant groups that were mainly aliens (herbaceous species and small and medium sized dispersal units and seeds), which together with their predominant use of aliens over natives within groups resulted in the highest overall frequency of alien seeds (73%). Rabbits were similar to kangaroos in the type of plants dispersed, but their predominant use of natives over aliens within groups contributed to an overall predominance of native seeds in their pellets (88%). Emus dispersed mostly plant groups that were mainly natives (e.g. woody species with big diaspores), resulting in low overall frequency of alien seeds (11%), despite their predominant use of aliens over natives within plant groups. Thus, the within-groups trend pointed to a facilitative role of native herbivores of plant invasions through seed dispersal, but was obscured by the different use by herbivores of plant groups with different frequency of aliens."

Using the exotic species, tree-of-heaven (Ailanthus altissima [Mill.] Swingle), in this study we estimated seed dispersal into water as a function of distance and experimentally tested seed buoyancy, secondary dispersal, and germinability after dispersal in water and on land. We found that biologically significant numbers of seeds disperse directly into water, remain buoyant, and are transported long distances by water. Germination rates for seeds that were kept in aqueous environments (Cheat Lake and the Monongahela River, near Morgantown, WV) were found to be similar to or higher than those in nearby terrestrial controls (F = 10.94, P = 0.0057). Seeds kept in aqueous environments retained high germination rates (94.4 +- 1.1%) even after 5 months. Although A. altissima may not disperse primarily through water environments, this study suggests that secondary dispersal by water is possible and may allow for long-distance dispersal more than two orders of magnitude farther than recorded primary dispersal."

Seedling defoliation, plant growth and flowering potential in native- and invasive-range Plantago lanceolata populations. Weed Research 52, 252-259. SummaryThe plastic response of weeds to new environmental conditions, in particular the likely relaxation of herbivore pressure, is considered vital for successful colonisation and spread. However, while variation in plant anti-herbivore resistance between native- and introduced-range populations is well studied, few authors have considered herbivore tolerance, especially at the seedling stage. This study examines variation in seedling tolerance in native (European) and introduced (North American) Plantago lanceolata populations following cotyledon removal at 14 days old. Subsequent effects on plant growth were quantified at 35 days, along with effects on flowering potential at maturity. Cotyledon removal reduced early growth for all populations, with no variation between introduced- or native-range plants. Although more variable, the effects of cotyledon loss on flowering potential were also unrelated to range. The likelihood that generalist seedling herbivores are common throughout North America may explain why no difference in seedling tolerance was apparent. However, increased flowering potential in plants from North American P. lanceolata populations was observed. As increased flowering potential was not lost, even after severe cotyledon damage, the manifestation of phenotypic plasticity in weeds at maturity may nonetheless still be shaped by plasticity in the ability to tolerate herbivory during seedling establishment."

Methods Native I. noli-tangere and three alien species (highly invasive I. glandulifera, less invasive I. parviflora and potentially invasive I. capensis) were studied and their responses to simulated canopy shading and different nutrient and moisture levels were determined in terms of survival and seedling traits. Key Results and Conclusions Impatiens glandulifera produced high biomass in all the treatments and the control, exhibiting the 'Jack-and-master' strategy that makes it a strong competitor from germination onwards. The results suggest that plasticity and differentiation occurred in all the species tested and that along the continuum from plasticity to differentiation, the species at the plasticity end is the better invader. The most invasive species I. glandulifera appears to be highly plastic, whereas the other two less invasive species, I. parviflora and I. capensis, exhibited lower plasticity but rather strong population differentiation. The invasive Impatiens species were taller and exhibited higher plasticity and differentiation than native I. noli-tangere. This suggests that even within one genus, the relative importance of the phenomena contributing to invasiveness appears to be species'specific."

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that sexually dichromatic plumage reduces the probability of success for 51 species from 26 genera of game birds that were introduced onto 12 oceanic islands. Analyses revealed no significant differences in probability of introduction success between monochromatic and dichromatic species at either the generic or specific levels. We also found no significant difference between these two groups in size of native geographic range, wing length or human-introduction effort. Our results do not support the hypothesis that sexually dichromatic plumage (probably a response to sexual selection) predicts introduction outcomes of game birds as has been reported for passerine birds. These findings suggest that passerine and non-passerine birds differ fundamentally in terms of factors that could influence introduction outcome, and should therefore be evaluated separately as opposed to lumping these two groups as 'land birds'."

On Oahu, the extinction rate for dimorphic species, 59%, is significantly greater than for monomorphic species, 23%. On Tahiti, only 7% of the introduced dimorphic species have persisted compared to 22% for the introduced monomorphic species. For the combined Oahu and Tahiti data sets, addition of plumage-by-fate interaction significantly improves the fit of the log-linear model, fate+island+plumage+(fate-by island)+(island-by-plumage). To control for phylogenetic constraint, a logistic regression model is analyzed using a data subset consisting of only the two best represented families, Fringillidae and Passeridae. Here, plumage and the plumage-by-family interaction are significant. Plumage is significantly associated with increased risk of extinction for passerids but insignificantly associated for fringillids. Thus, the hypothesis that response to sexual selection increases the risk of extinction is supported for passerids and for the data set as a whole. The probability of extinction was correlated with the number of species already introduced. Thus, species that have responded to sexual selection may be poorer interspecific competitors when their communities contain many other species."

Results of Duncan's multiple comparison test showed that the most discriminative ratios were the width of nacreous layer of right valve to the inflation of shell, the hinge line length to the maximum width of shell and the nacre thickness to the maximum width of shell. The analysis of variance revealed an important inter-population morphological variability. Both multidimensional scaling analysis and the squared Mahalanobis distances (D-2) of metric ratios divided Tunisian P. radiata populations into four biogeographical groupings: the north coast (La Marsa); harbours (Hammamet, Monastir and Zarzis); the Gulf of Gabe's (Sfax, Kerkennah Island, Mahare's, Skhira and Djerba) and the intertidal area (Ajim).

We sowed seeds and transplanted 3-week old seedlings of A. hybridus into plots containing monocultures and mixtures of varying composition, subjected plots to water, soil disturbance, and synthetic bovine urine (SBU) treatments, and measured A. hybridus emergence, recruitment, and growth rate. Following SBU addition, transplanted seedling growth increased in all plots but differed among legume and nonlegume monocultures and mixtures of these plant types. However, SBU decreased the number and recruitment rate of emerged seedlings because high residential growth reduced light availability. Nutrient pulses can therefore have strong but opposing effects on invasibility, depending on when they coincide with particular life history stages of an invader. Indeed, in SBU-treated plots, small differences in height of transplanted seedlings early on produced large differences in their final biomass. All facilitative effects of small-scale disturbance on invasion success diminished when productivity-promoting factors were present, suggesting that disturbance patch size is important. Precipitation-induced invasion resistance of C-3 pastures by a C-4 invader was partly supported. In grazed grasslands, these biotic and environmental factors vary across scales and interact in complex ways to affect invasibility, thus a dynamic patch mosaic of differential invasion resistance likely occurs in single fields. We propose that disturbance patch size, grazing intensity, soil resource availability, and resident composition are inextricably linked to grassland invasions and comment on the utility of community attributes as reliable predictors of invasibility. Lastly, we suggest temporal as well as spatial coincidences of multiple invasion facilitators dictate the window of opportunity for invasion."

We examined the interactive role of habitat alteration (i.e., shoreline development) in driving this invasion and its consequences for plant richness in New England salt marshes. We surveyed 22 salt marshes in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, and quantified shoreline development, Phragmites cover, soil salinity, and nitrogen availability. Shoreline development, operationally defined as removal of the woody vegetation bordering marshes, explained >90% of intermarsh variation in Phragmites cover. Shoreline development was also significantly correlated with reduced soil salinities and increased nitrogen availability, suggesting that removing woody vegetation bordering marshes increases nitrogen availability and decreases soil salinities, thus facilitating Phragmites invasion. Soil salinity (64%) and nitrogen availability (56%) alone explained a large proportion of variation in Phragmites cover, but together they explained 80% of the variation in Phragmites invasion success. Both univariate and aggregate (multidimensional scaling) analyses of plant community composition revealed that Phragmites dominance in developed salt marshes resulted in an almost three-fold decrease in plant species richness. Our findings illustrate the importance of maintaining integrity of habitat borders in conserving natural communities and provide an example of the critical role that local conservation can play in preserving these systems. In addition, our findings provide ecologists and natural resource managers with a mechanistic understanding of how human habitat alteration in one vegetation community can interact with species introductions in adjacent communities (i.e., flow-on or adjacency effects) to hasten ecosystem degradation."

Invading species typically need to overcome multiple limiting factors simultaneously in order to become established, and understanding how such factors interact to regulate the invasion process remains a major challenge in ecology. 2. We used the invasion of marine algal communities by the seaweed Sargassum muticum as a study system to experimentally investigate the independent and interactive effects of disturbance and propagule pressure in the short term. Based on our experimental results, we parameterized an integrodifference equation model, which we used to examine how disturbances created by different benthic herbivores influence the longer term invasion success of S. muticum. 3. Our experimental results demonstrate that in this system neither disturbance nor propagule input alone was sufficient to maximize invasion success. Rather, the interaction between these processes was critical for understanding how the S. muticum invasion is regulated in the short term. 4. The model showed that both the size and spatial arrangement of herbivore disturbances had a major impact on how disturbance facilitated the invasion, by jointly determining how much space-limitation was alleviated and how readily disturbed areas could be reached by dispersing propagules. 5. Synthesis. Both the short-term experiment and the long-term model show that S. muticum invasion success is co-regulated by disturbance and propagule pressure. Our results underscore the importance of considering interactive effects when making predictions about invasion success."

Three components of invasibility, i.e. species richness, density and biomass of invaders, have been monitored in burnt and unburnt experimental plots with resident diversity ranging from monocultures to 18-species mixtures. In general, species richness, density and biomass of invaders decreased significantly with the increase of resident species richness. Furthermore, the density and biomass of invading species were significantly influenced by the species composition of resident communities. Although aboveground biomass, leaf area index, canopy height and percent bare ground of the resident communities explained a significant part of the variation in the success of invading species, these covariates did not fully explain the effects of resident species richness. Fire mainly influenced invasibility via soil nutrient levels. The effect of fire on observed invasibility patterns seems to be less important than the effects of resident species richness. Our results demonstrate the importance of species richness and composition in controlling the initial stages of plant invasions in Mediterranean grasslands but that there was a lack of interaction with the effects of fire disturbance."

Across forests in North America, increased white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) abundance and non-native earthworms may facilitate non-native plant invasions. While each agent may exert independent effects, earthworms and deer often co-occur and their combined effects are difficult to predict based solely on knowledge of their individual effects. Using a network of twelve forested sites that differ in earthworm density, we evaluated deer exclusion effects (30 x 30 m; with an adjacent similar sized unfenced control plot) on cover, growth and reproduction of three non-native plant species: Alliaria petiolata, Berberis thunbergii and Microstegium vimineum. In addition, we assessed interactive effects of deer exclusion and earthworm invasions on B. thunbergii ring-growth. Five years after fence construction, A. petiolata frequency and density, B. thunbergii height, and M. vimineum cover were all significantly lower in fenced compared to open plots. In addition, B. thunbergii ring-growth was significantly lower in fenced compared to open plots, and ring-growth was positively correlated with earthworm density. Moreover, deer access and earthworm density synergistically interacted resulting in highest B. thunbergii ring-growth in open plots at sites with higher earthworm density. Results indicate facilitative effects of deer on non-native plant species and highlight the importance of understanding interactions among co-occurring factors in order to understand non-native species success. Successful long-term control of invasive plants may require a reduction in deer abundance, rather than just removing invasive plant species. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Recent studies, however, have shown the crucial role of the matrix in maintaining diversity in fragmented landscapes, acting as a mosaic of units with varying permeability to different species. Inclusion of matrix quality parameters is especially urgent in managing fragmented landscapes in the tropics where agriculture frontiers are still expanding. Using standardized surveys in 23 sites in an Atlantic forest landscape, we evaluated matrix use by small mammals, the most diverse ecological group of mammals in the Neotropics, and tested the hypothesis that endemic species are the most affected by the conversion of original forest into anthropogenic habitats. By comparing species distribution among forest remnants and the predominant adjacent habitats (native vegetation in initial stages of regeneration, eucalyptus plantations, areas of agriculture and rural areas with buildings), we found a strong dissimilarity in small mammal assemblages between native vegetation (including initial stages) and anthropogenic habitats, with only two species being able to use all habitats. Endemic small mammals tended to occupy native vegetation, whereas invading species from other countries or open biomes tended to occupy areas of non-native vegetation. Our results highlight that future destruction of native vegetation will favor invading or generalist species which could dominate highly disturbed landscapes, and that some matrix habitats, such as regenerating native vegetation, should be managed to increase connectivity among populations of endemic species."

We hypothesized that the disturbance conditions prevailing in abandoned agricultural fields right after abandonment may enhance the emergence, survival and growth of P. coccinea, but that shortly after abandonment colonizing vegetation prevents further establishment of this species. We conducted a field experiment to evaluate this hypothesis, studying the response of seedling emergence and growth of P. coccinea to soil and vegetation disturbance. Our results show that both lack of vegetation cover and soil disturbance promote the emergence of seedlings of P. coccinea. Thus, the disturbance conditions prevailing in abandoned agricultural fields seem crucial to allow establishment of this species.

However, positive soil feedback may also be due to enhanced benefit from the local arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). Few studies actually have tested pathogen effects, and none of them did so in arid savannas. In the Kalahari savanna in Botswana, we compared the soil feedback of the exotic grass Cenchrus biflorus with that of two dominant native grasses, Eragrostis lehmanniana and Aristida meridionalis. The exotic grass had neutral to positive soil feedback, whereas both native grasses showed neutral to negative feedback effects. Isolation and testing of root-inhabiting fungi of E. lehmanniana yielded two host-specific pathogens that did not influence the exotic C. biflorus or the other native grass, A. meridionalis. None of the grasses was affected by the fungi that were isolated from the roots of the exotic C. biflorus. We isolated and compared the AMF community of the native and exotic grasses by polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel elecrophoresis (PCR-DGGE), targeting AMF 18S rRNA. We used roots from monospecific field stands and from plants grown in pots with mixtures of soils from the monospecific field stands. Three-quarters of the root samples of the exotic grass had two nearly identical sequences, showing 99% similarity with Glomus versiforme. The two native grasses were also associated with distinct bands, but each of these bands occurred in only a fraction of the root samples. The native grasses contained a higher diversity of AMF bands than the exotic grass. Canonical correspondence analyses of the AMF band patterns revealed almost as much difference between the native and exotic grasses as between the native grasses. In conclusion, our results support the hypothesis that release from soil-borne enemies may facilitate local abundance of exotic plants, and we provide the first evidence that these processes may occur in arid savanna ecosystems. Pathogenicity tests implicated the involvement of soil pathogens in the soil feedback responses, and further studies should reveal the functional consequences of the observed high infection with a low diversity of AMF in the roots of exotic plants."

As no categorization of the impact of alien bird species is available so far, we adopted an impact scoring system for mammals to birds and scored the impact of the alien birds established in Europe. We investigated 26 established alien birds in Europe and compiled all known impact data for these species. The species with highest environmental impact were the Canada goose (Branta canadensis), sacred ibis (Threskiornis aethiopicus) and ruddy duck (Oxyura jamaicensis). The most severe impact on economy was exerted again by the Canada goose. Also the ring-necked parakeet (Psittacula krameri) and monk parakeet (Myiopsitta monachus) had high impact in this category. Combining these potential impact data with the current distribution generates a list of alien birds with highest actual impact. These two values can be used to prioritise preventive and control measures. In comparison to birds, mammals in general have higher potential and actual impact in Europe, but some bird species reach impact values as high as some of the worst mammal species. Still, these bird species - in contrast to mammals with high impact - are hardly targeted by control programmes. This study shows that there is no scientific reason for this. With the here presented scoring system we offer a decision tool to practitioners which supports them in finding an appropriate reaction to invasive birds. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

We studied locally sympatric populations of the invasive Ardisia elliptica and the native A. obovata (Myrsinaceae) in Puerto Rico. We compared spatial distribution, herbivory and growth in seedlings, seed germination in the field and under controlled conditions, and fruit production. We found the distribution of each species was aggregated in the three categories of size (seedlings, juveniles and adults) and the populations partially overlapped. The invasive species was the most abundant species in every category of size. The two species did not differ in percentage of leaf area consumed and seedlings of both species had the same relative growth rate (RGR) in the forest. However, the invasive species had higher germination success in the field, faster mean germination time in the lab and higher fruit production. It appears that the success of A. elliptica is not through escape from pathogens or herbivores, but by a better performance in fruiting and seed germination in the forest."

Landscapes with more spatial heterogeneity in the environment can sustain more native and more exotic species, leading to a positive correlation of native and exotic diversity at large scales. In a nested data set for grassland plants, we detected negative relationships between native and exotic diversity at small spatial scales and positive relationships at large spatial scales. Supporting our hypothesis, the positive relationships, between native and exotic diversity at large scales were driven by positive relationships between native and exotic beta diversity. Further, both native and exotic diversity were positively correlated with spatial heterogeneity in abiotic conditions (variance of soil depth, soil nitrogen, and aspect) but were uncorrelated with average abiotic conditions, supporting the spatial-heterogeneity hypothesis but not the favorable-conditions hypothesis."

Field surveys and laboratory experiments were conducted to test the theory of ""biotic resistance"" and ascertain the relationship between native species richness and the invasion of Nile tilapia. In the field, we found that as native species richness increased, the biomass of Nile tilapia was significantly reduced.

A total of 481 specimens were collected and identified as eight species, most of them nonnative. Hypothenemus formed the overwhelming majority of bark beetles (Scolytinae) collected, confirming the dominance of the genus in urban environments. Hypothenemus brunneus (Hopkins) and Hypothenemus seriatus (Eichhoff) were most abundant, comprising 74% of the capture. Rarefaction showed that the sample was sufficient to characterize the local diversity and composition. The seasonal pattern in Hypothenemus capture was positively correlated to day-time temperature, not to season as in most temperate Scolytinae. Another significant observation in the community dynamics was the synchronized occurrence of two common species (H. birmanus and H. javanus), unrelated to season. Hypothenemus were predominantly diurnal with a broad flight window. Females flew as early as 11: 00 hours (EDST), with peak flight occurring at 15: 00 hours, significantly earlier than flight patterns of most other Scolytinae. Surprisingly, male Hypothenemus were frequently collected, despite their lack of functional wings. Several potential explanations are discussed. This is the first study into the ecology of an entire community of the twig-feeding Hypothenemus."

Although experimental studies extensively document the effects of species richness on invader performance, the role of species evenness in such studies is rarely examined. Species evenness warrants more attention because the relative abundances of species can account for substantially more of the variance in plant community diversity and tend to change more rapidly and more frequently in response to disturbances than the absolute numbers of species. In this study, we experimentally manipulated species evenness within native prairie grassland mesocosms. We assessed how evenness affected primary productivity, light availability and the resistance of native communities to invasion. The primary productivity of native communities increased significantly with species evenness, and this increase in productivity was accompanied by significant decreases in light availability. However, evenness had no effect on native community resistance to invasion by three common exotic invasive species. In this study, niche complementarity provides a potential mechanism for the effects of evenness on productivity and light availability, but these effects apparently were not strong enough to alter the invasibility of the experimental communities. Our results suggest that species evenness enhances community productivity but provides no benefit to invasion resistance in otherwise functionally diverse communities."

We used common garden and plant-soil feedback experiments with soils and seeds from native Eurasian and introduced Californian populations. We found that performance of Centaurea did not differ among source genotypes, implying that the success of this invasive species is not due to evolutionary changes.

In the present study, these 2 hypotheses were tested on NW Mediterranean shallow subtidal macrophyte assemblages. Data collection was carried out in early summer 2002 on sub-horizontal rocky substrate at 9 sites along the French Mediterranean coast, 4 undisturbed and 5 highly disturbed. Disturbances include cargo, naval and passenger harbours, and industrial and urban pollution. Relationships between species richness (point diversity), disturbances and the number of introduced macrophytes were analysed.

Soc. 135: 540-553. 2008.-Abiotic factors, particularly area, and biotic factors play important roles in determining species richness of continental islands Such as cedar glades. We examined the relationship between environmental parameters and species richness on glades and the influence of native species richness on exotic invasion. Field surveys of vascular plants on 40 cedar glades in Rutherford County, Tennessee were conducted during the 2001-2003 growing seasons. Glades were geo-referenced to obtain area, perimeter, distance from autotour road, and degree of isolation. Amount of disturbance also was recorded. Two-hundred thirty two taxa were found with Andropogon virginicus, Croton monanthogynus. Juniperus virginiana, Panicum flexile, and Ulmus alata present on all glades. The exotics Ligustrum sinense, Leucanthemum vulgare, and Taraxacum officinale occurred on the majority of glades. Lobelia appendiculata var. gattingeri, Leavenworthia stylosa, and Pediomelum subacaule were the most frequent endemics. Richness of native. exotic and endemic species increased with increasing area and perimeter and decreased with increasing isolation (P <= 0.03); richness was unrelated to distance to road (P >= 0.20). Perimeter explained a greater amount of variation than area for native and exotic species, whereas area accounted For greater variation for endemic species. Slope of the relationship between area and total richness (0.17) was within the range reported for continental islands. Disturbed glades contained a higher number of exotic and native species than nondisturbed ones. but they were larger (P <= 0.03). Invasion of exotic species was unrelated to native species richness when glade size was statistically controlled (P = 0.88). Absence of a relationship is probably due to a lack of substantial competitive interactions. Most endemics occurred over a broad range of glade sizes emphasizing the point that glades of all sizes are worthy of protection."

Fragments of the two introduced species Caulerpa tax folia (Vahl) C. Agardh and Caulerpa racemosa (Forsskal) J. Agardh were transplanted in each of the three assemblages. Width of the colony, blade density and percentage of the substratum covered by the two species were measured. The susceptibility of the indigenous community to the spread of Caulerpa species was related to type of assemblage. Blade density and amount of substratum covered by the two Caulerpa species were different between species and generally greater for C taxifiolia than for C racemosa. Overall, the spread of these species was strongly dependent on the type but not directly on the complexity of the assemblage. Turf was more favourable than encrusting species alone, while the least advantageous habitat was where the macroalgal assemblage is composed of encrusting, turf and erect species. In other words, increased number of species in the assemblage reduces invasion of the Caulerpa species but the type of algae in the assemblage is likely to be more important than number of species. The presence of turf promotes the spread of Caulerpa species. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved."

Its high phenotypic plasticity, expressed in different allocation patterns in sun and shade individuals, and its clonal growth which promotes the continuous search of available resources, contributed to a good growth and photochemical efficiency of Carpobrotus in the relatively moderate shade of the understories of Mediterranean shrublands and woodlands. Each main shoot of a Carpobrotus clone (which can have several dozens main shoots) grows ca. 40 cm per year, which explains its vigorous habitat colonization capacity. Conclusion: The highly plastic morphological response to different light regimes of this taxon contributes to a rapid colonization of heterogeneous coastal Mediterranean environments spreading well beyond the open sand dune systems where it has been often reported."

Our hypothesis is that the strategy of the invasive L. grandiflora differs according to the growth form of this plant (submerged/emergent) and to its density, and the presence and the density of neighbouring species, during the first step of introduction phase. Moreover, we also suppose that the invasive species L grandiflora affects the European native aquatic macrophyte and that invasive species can facilitate the establishment, growth and spread of exotic species coming from the same biogeographical area (the ""Invasional Meltdown Hypothesis""). We studied the relationships between three exotic species coming from South America (Ludwigia grandiflora, Egeria densa and Myriophyllum aquaticum) and two European macrophyte species (Ceratophyllum demersum, Mentha aquatica) in monocultures and in mixed cultures. The experiments were carried out in containers placed in a greenhouse for one month in spring 2011. We measured six morphological traits to test the intraspecific and interspecific interferences. In accordance with our hypothesis, the strategy of L. grandiflora differed between its emergent growth form and its submerged growth form, whereas the establishment and the growth of L grandiflora did not seem to be facilitated by other exotic species (i.e. E. densa and M. aquaticum). The interspecific effect between C. demersum or E. densa on submerged L. grandiflora was stronger in inhibiting plant growth than the intraspecific interferences of L grandiflora on itself. Mutual inhibition of root production and growth was observed between L grandiflora and M. aquatica. However, L. grandiflora seemed to have little impact on native species, which may coexist with L. grandiflora during the early stages of L grandiflora establishment in the introduction area. L grandiflora stimulated the growth and the vegetative reproduction of E. densa. L grandiflora facilitated the establishment of E.densa in accordance with the ""Invasional Meltdown Hypothesis"". L grandiflora stimulated the root production and the growth of M. aquaticum at low densities and inhibited it at high densities. L grandiflora, the first introduced plant in France, could slightly facilitate the growth of E. densa. However, spatial heterogeneity or differential use of resources could explain the coexistence of L grandiflora and M. aquaticum in the same environment.. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

For instance, resource availability and biotic interactions may represent filters that limit the success of potential invaders. Communities are predicted to resist invasion when they contain native species that are functionally similar to potential invaders; where phenology may be a key functional trait. Nutrient reduction is another common strategy for reducing invasion following native species restoration, because soil nitrogen (N) enrichment often facilitates invasion. Here, we focus on restoring the herbaceous community associated with coastal sage scrub vegetation in Southern California; these communities are often highly invaded, especially by exotic annual grasses that are notoriously challenging for restoration. We created experimental plant communities composed of the same 20 native species, but manipulated functional group abundance (according to growth form, phenology, and N-fixation capacity) and soil N availability. We fertilized to increase N, and added carbon to reduce N via microbial N immobilization. We found that N reduction decreased exotic cover, and the most successful seed mix for reducing exotic abundance varied depending on the invader functional type. For instance, exotic annual grasses were least abundant when the native community was dominated by early active forbs, which matched the phenology of the exotic annual grasses. Our findings show that nutrient availability and the timing of biotic interactions are key filters that can be manipulated in restoration to prevent invasion and maximize native species recovery."

Do invasion-diversity relationships change when abiotic and biotic legacies, rather than stress, act as non-selective drivers of richness? LocationCalcareous fens, Wisconsin, USA. MethodsWe compared plot-level relationships between native and invasive species richness in 220 plots in 11 calcareous fens, six of which had stress alleviation and community impoverishment due to historic ploughing. We measured nutrient availability (resource stress) and saturation stress (non-resource stress), native richness and invasive richness in each plot. ResultsResidual maximum likelihood (REML) regression found a negative correlation between native and invasive richness in never ploughed plots, but no relationship was found in ploughed plots. REML multiple regression found that after accounting for saturation and nutrients, there was no relationship between native and invasive richness in ploughed or never ploughed plots. Saturation stress predicted low invasive richness and high native richness in never ploughed plots. Time since abandonment did not predict invasive richness. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) found most invasive species present only in areas with the least saturation stress. ConclusionsNegative relationships between native and invasive richness can result when the main driver of native richness favour native species (such as stress), and therefore may not support the diversity-resistance hypothesis. When the main driver of native richness does not select between native and invasive richness, there may be no relationship between native and invasive richness, even at very small spatial scales."

We investigated how root competition by an invasive tree, Cinnamomum verum, affects regeneration in nutrient-poor tropical secondary forests, in the Seychelles. We performed three trenching experiments to investigate the effects of severing the root systems of mature trees on the growth of juveniles. These experiments had the following objectives: (i) to compare the responses of native and invasive saplings to release from root competition; (ii) to compare how seedlings (< 50 cm tall) and saplings (> 50 cm tall) of C. verum respond to trenching; and (iii) to compare the response of C. verum seedlings to trenching in forest stands with and without C. verum as the dominant species. The results indicate that the dense topsoil root mat produced by mature C. verum trees suppresses the growth of young trees, mainly by increasing competition for scarce nutrients. Growth responses to trenching were stronger for seedlings than saplings, and stronger for juveniles of invasive than of native species. We conclude that stands of C. verum exert a strong below-ground filtering effect on seedling regeneration. This effect is likely to influence secondary forest succession by selectively reducing the establishment of invasive and small-seeded species. Because of the bias in invasion biology towards relatively nutrient-rich, productive ecosystems, few studies have investigated the role of below-ground resource competition in plant invasions. Our results for an infertile, phosphorus-poor ecosystem show that root competition by an alien species can exert a strong influence on forest regeneration. We suggest that this mechanism may be of general importance in nutrient-poor tropical forests invaded by alien tree species."

The invasional meltdown and enemy inversion hypotheses suggest that non-native herbivores may indirectly facilitate the invasion of a non-native plant species by either favorably changing environmental conditions or reducing competition from native plant species. Our objective was to determine the role of herbivory by the non-native snail Otala lactea in structuring California grassland communities. We conducted two experiments to examine the feeding preferences of O. lactea for eight representative grassland species. Overall, O. lactea preferred Brassica nigra, a non-native forb, over all other species tested. Field monocultures of B. nigra supported significantly higher snail densities than monocultures of any of the other species tested. O. lactea also preferred B. nigra over all other species tested in controlled laboratory feeding trials. However, based on trait comparisons of each of the eight grassland species, we cannot pinpoint the preference for B. nigra to a basic nutritional requirement on the part of the herbivore or an allocation to defense on the part of the plants. Our study provides evidence for an antagonistic relationship between a non-native herbivore and a non-native plant species in their invasive range. We term this relationship ""invasional antagonism""."

How biotic resistance develops over time in these ecosystems will depend on how established invaders contribute to subsequent resistance. If invasion success and defence capacity (i.e. contribution to resistance) are correlated, then community resistance should increase as species accumulate. If successful invaders also cause most impact (through replacing native species with low defence capacity) then the effect will be even stronger. If successful invaders instead have weak defence capacity or even facilitative attributes, then resistance should decrease with time, as proposed by the invasional meltdown hypothesis. We analysed 1157 introductions of freshwater fish in Swedish lakes and found that species' invasion success was positively correlated with their defence capacity and impact, suggesting that these communities will develop stronger resistance over time.

We replicated our seed addition x herbivore exclusion experiment at multiple grassland sites, located within a few km of each other in two regions, coastal central California (USA) and southern Saxony-Anhalt (Germany). The two study regions differed in climate, land-use, invasion history and species pools which allowed us to disentangle general from context-specific effects. In both regions, herbivory by gastropods had a stronger impact on the proportion of recruited seedlings and the proportion of recruited species than rodent herbivory, but this effect was much more pronounced in California than in Germany. Especially, seedling recruitment of non-legume herbs and legumes suffered from gastropod herbivory. Contrastingly, the effect of rodents was negative at the German sites and positive at the Californian sites, likely driven by context-specific differences in the rodent assemblages. Across both study regions, exotics had higher seedling recruitment than natives, indicating that higher recruitment success constitutes an inherent feature of exotic species. After two years, more exotic than native species established at grassland sites in California while the opposite was true for the German grassland sites. Consistently across regions, native and exotic species did, however, not differ in their response to herbivory, suggesting that generalist consumers suppress recruitment and colonization of plant species irrespective of their origin. Our results demonstrate the importance of a multi-species, multi-site approach to separate general responses of exotic and native plants to generalist herbivory from local, regional or species-specific peculiarities."

This in turn can select for species with traits suited for the new growing environment. We used adjacent uninvaded and invaded grassland patches to evaluate whether the shift in dominance from a native perennial bunchgrass, Nassella pulchra, to the early season, non-native annual grass, Bromus diandrus, affects the physical structure, available light, plant community composition and community-weighted trait means. Our field surveys revealed that the exotic grass B.diandrus alters both the vertical and horizontal structure creating more dense continuous vegetative growth and dead plant biomass than patches dominated by N.pulchra. These differences in physical structure are responsible for a threefold reduction in available light and likely contribute to the lower diversity, especially of native forbs in B.diandrus-dominated patches. Further, flowering time began earlier and seed size and plant height were higher in B.diandrus patches relative to N.pulchra patches. Our results suggest that species that are better suited (earlier phenology, larger seed size and taller) for low light availability are those that coexist with B.diandrus, and this is consistent with our hypothesis that change in physical structure with B.diandrus invasion is an important driver of community and trait composition. The traits of species able to coexist with invaders are rarely considered when assessing community change following invasion; however, this may be a powerful approach for predicting community change in environments with high anthropogenic pressures, such as disturbance and nutrient enrichment. It also provides a means for selecting species to introduce when trying to enhance native diversity in an otherwise invaded community."

The study was established at 33 grassland sites in central German river valleys. Species composition, environmental variables, past and current management, and the distance to source populations of characteristic species of traditional management (indicator species) were recorded and compared using multivariate statistics. We further tested the speed of colonization by two indicator species, Silaum silaus and Serratula tinctoria, along transects from source populations into unoccupied fields. The species composition of the successional grassland was mainly determined by elevation, total soil nitrogen, distance to remnant species-rich grasslands and frequency of mowing or grazing. Elevation and distance were negatively, and frequency was positively related to the occurrence of late successional species. Colonization by indicator species was only dependent on the distance to source populations; other explanatory variables were not significant. Migration from adjacent source sites of S. silaus and S. tinctoria into re-converted grasslands was slow, reaching only 40 m and 15 m after 15 years. Synthesis and applications. The results demonstrated the limitations of the deterministic view on plant succession and the high relative importance of propagule availability in grassland restoration.

In particular, Ponto-Caspian gobiid fishes and amphipods are suspected to have pronounced effects on aquatic food webs. However, there is a lack of systematic studies mechanistically testing the potential synergistic effects of invasive species on native fauna. In this study we investigated the interrelations between the invasive amphipod Dikerogammarus villosus and the invasive fish species Neogobius melanostomus in their effects on the native amphipod Gammarus pulex. We hypothesized selective predation by the fish as a driver for displacement of native species resulting in potential extinction of G. pulex. The survival of G. pulex in the presence of N. melanostomus in relation to the presence of D. villosus and availability of shelter was analyzed in the context of behavioural differences between the amphipod species. Results: Gammarus pulex had a significantly higher susceptibility to predation by N. melanostomus compared to D. villosus in all experiments, suggesting preferential predation by this fish on native gammarids. Furthermore, the presence of D. villosus significantly increased the vulnerability of G. pulex to fish predation. Habitat structure was an important factor for swimming activity of amphipods and their mortality, resulting in a threefold decrease in amphipods consumed with shelter habitat structures provided. Behavioral differences in swimming activity were additionally responsible for higher predation rates on G. pulex. Intraguild predation could be neglected within short experimental durations. Conclusions: The results of this study provide evidence for synergistic effects of the two invasive Ponto-Caspian species on the native amphipod as an underlying process of species displacements during invasion processes. Prey behaviour and monotonous habitat structures additionally contribute to the decline of the native gammarid fauna in the upper Danube River and elsewhere."

The alternative hypothesis that the occurrence of these exotics is affected by fetch and underwater radiation (important determinants of macrophyte assemblage composition in this reservoir) was also tested. incidence data (presence/absence) was obtained over 9.5 years at 235 stations. Logistic regression was applied to test whether the likelihood of occurrence of these two species was affected by macrophyte richness, fetch or underwater radiation. Tenner-grass was recorded at a high frequency and quickly recovered from disturbances caused by water drawdown. In contrast, H. verticillata was first recorded in 3 sites in January 2007, but it spread quickly, reaching 30.5% of the sites 19 months later. The main channel of the Parana River was the main source of propagules for this species. The likelihood of occurrence of tenner-grass was positively affected by macrophyte richness but negatively affected by fetch. Thus, wave disturbance is probably more important than diversity in preventing invasion by this species. Hydrilla, by contrast, was negatively affected by macrophyte richness and positively affected by fetch and underwater radiation. Although this result might indicate that macrophyte diversity prevents hydrilla invasion, this is probably not true because hydrilla colonized deeper sites where few species of plant exist. Resistance to disturbances caused by water drawdown (tenner-grass) and waves (hydrilla) as well as persistency of tenner-grass and fast spread of hydrilla make these exotic species a cause for concern because of their potential impacts on water uses and maintenance of diversity.

We explored resistance to plant invaders by eliminating or decreasing the number of understory plant species in particular functional groups from plots at a riparian site in southwestern Virginia, USA. Our functional groups comprise combinations of aboveground biomass and rooting structure type. Manipulated plots were planted with 10 randomly chosen species from widespread native and introduced plants commonly found throughout the floodplains of Big Stony Creek. We assessed success of an invasion by plant survivorship and growth. We analyzed survivorship of functional groups with loglinear models for the analysis of categorical data in a 4-way table. There was a significant interaction between functional groups removed in a plot and survivorship in the functional groups added to that plot. However, survivorship of species in functional groups introduced into plots with their respective functional group removed did not differ from survivorship when any other functional group was removed. Additionally, growth of each of the most abundant species did not differ significantly among plots with different functional groups manipulated. Specifically, species did not fare better in those plots that had representatives of their own functional group removed. Fox's assembly rule does not hold for these functional groups in this plant community; however, composition of the recipient community is a significant factor in community assembly."

We hypothesized that populations of these summer-flowering Centaurea species must pass through a demographic gauntlet of survival and reproduction in order to persist and that the most invasive species (C. solstitialis) might possess unique life history characteristics. Using the idea of a demographic gauntlet as a conceptual framework, we compared each congener in terms of (1) seed germination and seedling establishment, (2) survival of rosettes subjected to competition from annual grasses, (3). subsequent growth and flowering in adult plants, and (4) variation in breeding system. Grazing and soil disturbance is thought to affect Centaurea establishment, growth, and reproduction, so we also explored differences among congeners in their response to clipping and to different sizes of soil disturbance. We found minimal differences among congeners,in either seed germination responses or seedling establishment and survival. In contrast,. differential growth responses of congeners to different sizes of canopy gaps led to large differences in adult size and fecundity. Canopy-gap size and clipping affected the fecundity of each species, but the most invasive species (C solstitialis) was unique in its strong positive response to combinations of clipping and canopy gaps. In addition, the phenology of C solstitialis allows this species to extend its growing season into the summer-a time when competition from winter annual vegetation for soil water is minimal. Surprisingly, C. solstitialis Was highly self-incompatible while the less invasive species were highly self-compatible. Our results suggest that the invasiveness of C. solstitialis. arises, in part, from its combined ability to persist in competition, with annual grasses and,its plastic growth and reproductive responses to open, disturbed habitat patches."

Digeneans are dominant macroparasites of molluscs; therefore, the interaction between R. philippinarum and these parasites was ideal for investigation. A two-year monitoring in Arcachon Bay (SW France) was performed to estimate digenean loads in R. philippinarum and in three infaunal native bivalves (R. decussatus, Paphia aurea, Cerastoderma edule). A laboratory experiment allowed comparison of infection success among these bivalves (except P. aurea) by generalist digenean larvae (Himasthla elongata cercariae). R. philippinarum digenean abundance in Arcachon Bay was much lower than in native bivalves, with values depending on species, sites and time. Similarly, mean digenean species richness per host individual was always lower in R. philippinarum than in sympatric bivalves. A comparison of digenean metacercariae abundance between R. decussatus and C. edule in Mundaka Estuary (Spain) showed that both species had similar digenean loads but that R. decussatus was depleted in digenean species encysting in host tissues (the non-gymnophallid species). Experimental infection confirmed that the two species of the genus Ruditapes (and not R. philippinarum only) were resistant to encysting digeneans, with an infection success 3-5 times lower than that of C. edule. The lack of infection that was observed in the field would therefore be the consequence of a tissue barrier, R. philippinarum epithelium being too tough for cercariae penetration. Concordantly, according to the literature, digenean infection in the native range of R. philippinarum is also low. Consequently, the ERH, as an explanation for R. philippinarum success in Europe, is not totally consistent in the case of digenean trematodes as enemies, R. philippinarum hosting low load of digeneans in its native as well as colonized range."

Theory from invasion biology suggests that the success of species introductions outside of their historical ranges may be either positively (biotic acceptance) or negatively (biotic resistance) related to native biodiversity. Using data on fish community composition from two survey periods separated by approximately 28years during which climate was warming, we examined the factors influencing the establishment of three predatory centrarchids: Smallmouth Bass (Micropterus dolomieu), Largemouth Bass (M. salmoides), and Rock Bass (Ambloplites rupestris) in lakes at their expanding northern range boundaries in Ontario. Variance partitioning demonstrated that, at a regional scale, abiotic factors play a stronger role in determining the establishment of these species than biotic factors. Pairing lakes within watersheds where each species had established with lakes sharing similar abiotic conditions where the species had not established revealed both positive and negative relationships between the establishment of centrarchids and the historical presence of other predatory species. The establishment of these species near their northern range boundaries is primarily determined by abiotic factors at a regional scale; however, biotic factors become important at the lake-to-lake scale. Studies of exotic species invasions have previously highlighted how spatial scale mediates the importance of abiotic vs. biotic factors on species establishment. Our study demonstrates how concepts from invasion biology can inform our understanding of the factors controlling species distributions with changing climate."

Due to climate change, increasing occurrences of extreme events such as droughts are expected in the Mediterranean region and invasive species may expand if they cope with water stress. Limited information is available on the responses of Acacia longifolia, one of the most aggressive plant species in Portuguese coastal sand dune ecosystems, to prolonged water stress. In this study, we exposed A. longifolia plants from two distinct populations, one from the wet (northern) and another from the dry (southern) climate regions of Portugal, to drought conditions, and monitored morphological, physiological and biochemical responses. One-month-old seedlings were submitted to three different water treatments which involved watering twice a week, every 7 days and every 10 days, respectively, for three months, under controlled conditions. Overall, the progressive drought stress significantly affected most of the growth parameters considered, except the root:shoot ratio. Water stress also increased the uptake of ions (Ca2+, Mg2+, K+ and Na+) and N concentration. On the contrary, the C/N ratio decreased under water stress conditions. Isotopic analysis did not reveal significant differences in delta C-13 with water treatments but the same pattern was not observed in delta N-15 values. Compared with the wet climate population, the dry climate population showed somewhat differing responses to water stress, indicating a genetic difference between populations. These results provide insights into limitations and opportunities for establishment of A. longifolia in a drought-prone scenario. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved."

We also used invasion scores from a weed risk assessment protocol as an independent measure of invasion risk and assessed differences in variables between high- and low-risk species. Location East Usambara mountains, Tanzania. Methods Forest transect surveys identified species establishing in disturbed and intact forest. Leaf traits (specific leaf area and foliar nutrient concentrations) were measured from leaves sampled in high-light environments. Results A leaf traits spectrum was apparent, but species succeeding or failing to establish in either disturbed or intact forest were not located in different parts of the spectrum. Species with high invasion risk did not differ in their location on the leaf trait spectrum compared with low-risk species but were more likely to be bird/primate-dispersed. For 15 species establishing in forest quadrats, median canopy cover of quadrats where seedlings were present was correlated with a species value along the leaf trait spectrum. Species establishing in disturbed forest were planted in twice as many plantations and were marginally more likely to be bird- or primate-dispersed than species failing to become established in disturbed forest. Establishment in intact forest was more likely for species planted closer to forest edges.

We also used invasion scores from a weed risk assessment protocol as an independent measure of invasion risk and assessed differences in variables between high- and low-risk species. Location East Usambara mountains, Tanzania. Methods Forest transect surveys identified species establishing in disturbed and intact forest. Leaf traits (specific leaf area and foliar nutrient concentrations) were measured from leaves sampled in high-light environments. Results A leaf traits spectrum was apparent, but species succeeding or failing to establish in either disturbed or intact forest were not located in different parts of the spectrum. Species with high invasion risk did not differ in their location on the leaf trait spectrum compared with low-risk species but were more likely to be bird/primate-dispersed. For 15 species establishing in forest quadrats, median canopy cover of quadrats where seedlings were present was correlated with a species value along the leaf trait spectrum. Species establishing in disturbed forest were planted in twice as many plantations and were marginally more likely to be bird- or primate-dispersed than species failing to become established in disturbed forest. Establishment in intact forest was more likely for species planted closer to forest edges. Main conclusions Leaf and dispersal traits appear less important in the colonization of tropical forest than introduction characteristics. It appears, given sufficient propagule pressure or proximity to forest, alien species are much more likely to establish independently of leaf traits or dispersal syndrome in continental tropical forests."

Aliens do not invade a vacuum, but rather a community consisting of native and often other alien species. Our current understanding of the pathways and network of interactions among multiple invasive species within whole communities is limited. Eradication efforts often focus on a single target species, potentially leading to unexpected outcomes on interacting non-target species. We aimed to examine the interaction network in a cavity-nesting community consisting of native and invasive birds. We studied the nesting cavities in the largest urban park in Israel over two breeding seasons. We found evidence for a complex interaction network that includes negative, neutral and positive interactions, but no synergistic positive interactions among aliens. Three major factors shaped the interaction network: breeding timing, nesting preferences and the ability to excavate or widen the cavities, which were found to be a limited resource. Cavity enlargement by the early-breeding invasive rose-ringed parakeet may enhance breeding of the invasive common myna in previously unavailable holes. The myna excludes the smaller invasive vinous-breasted starling, a direct competitor of the primary nest excavator, the native Syrian woodpecker. Therefore, management and eradication efforts directed towards the common myna alone may actually release the vinous-breasted starling from competitive exclusion by the common myna, increasing the negative impact of the vinous-breasted starling on the native community. As found here, interactions among multiple alien species can be crucial in shaping invasion success and should be carefully considered when aiming to effectively manage biological invasions."

Biological invasion theory predicts that the introduction and establishment of non-native species is positively correlated with propagule pressure. Releases of pet and aquarium fishes to inland waters has a long history; however, few studies have examined the demographic basis of their importation and incidence in the wild. 2. For the 1500 grid squares (10 x 10 km) that make up England, data on human demographics (population density, numbers of pet shops, garden centres and fish farms), the numbers of non-native freshwater fishes (from consented licences) imported in those grid squares (i.e. propagule pressure), and the reported incidences (in a national database) of non-native fishes in the wild were used to examine spatial relationships between the occurrence of non-native fishes and the demographic factors associated with propagule pressure, as well as to test whether the demographic factors are statistically reliable predictors of the incidence of non-native fishes, and as such surrogate estimators of propagule pressure. 3. Principal coordinates of neighbour matrices analyses, used to generate spatially explicit models, and confirmatory factor analysis revealed that spatial distributions of non-native species in England were significantly related to human population density, garden centre density and fish farm density. Human population density and the number of fish imports were identified as the best predictors of propagule pressure. 4. Human population density is an effective surrogate estimator of non-native fish propagule pressure and can be used to predict likely areas of non-native fish introductions. In conjunction with fish movements, where available, human population densities can be used to support biological invasion monitoring programmes across Europe (and perhaps globally) and to inform management decisions as regards the prioritization of areas for the control of non-native fish introductions.

What are the distribution and habitat associations of non-native (neophyte) species in riparian zones? 2. Are there significant differences, in terms of plant species diversity, composition, habitat condition and species attributes, between plant communities where non-natives are present or abundant and those where non-natives are absent or infrequent? 3. Are the observed differences generic to non-natives or do individual non-native species differ in their vegetation associations? Location: West Midlands Conurbation (WMC), UK. Methods: 56 sites were located randomly on four rivers across the WMC. Ten 2 m x 2 m quadrats were placed within 15 m of the river to sample vegetation within the floodplain at each site. All vascular plants were recorded along with site information such as surrounding land use and habitat types. Results: Non-native species were found in many vegetation types and on all rivers in the WMC. There were higher numbers of non-natives on more degraded, human-modified rivers. More non-native species were found in woodland, scrub and tall herb habitats than in grasslands. We distinguish two types of communities with non-natives. In communities colonized following disturbance, in comparison to quadrats containing no non-native species, those with non-natives had higher species diversity and more forbs, annuals and short-lived monocarpic perennials. Native species in quadrats containing non-natives were characteristic of conditions of higher fertility and pH, had a larger specific leaf area and were less stress tolerant or competitive. In later successional communities dominated by particular non-natives, native diversity declined with increasing cover of non-natives. Associated native species were characteristic of low light conditions. Conclusions: Communities containing non-natives can be associated with particular types of native species. Extrinsic factors (disturbance. eutrophication) affected both native and non-native species. In disturbed riparian habitats the key determinant of diversity is dominance by competitive invasive species regardless of their native or non-native origin."

We evaluated the effect of vertebrate herbivory on the seedling survival of two widely planted and invasive tree species (Pinus radiata and Eucalyptus globulus), in a Mediterranean-type ecosystem of central Chile. An important role of herbivory on seedling survival of these two species in their introduced ranges has previously been documented. However, this has mainly been evaluated in forest plantations where habitat and vegetation conditions differ from wild habitats in which invasion occurs. We planted seedlings with and without protection against vertebrate herbivores in different aspects (a mesic south-facing slope and a xeric north-facing slope) and vegetation cover (open sites and sites with patchy tree cover). We found that regardless of aspect or vegetation cover, herbivory, in this case mainly caused by exotic vertebrates, significantly and negatively affected seedling survival of both species. However, while the effect of herbivory on P. radiata was significant in every vegetation and habitat condition, for E. globulus, the effect of herbivory was significant only for open sites in the mesic habitat. These results suggest that, as observed in forestry plantations, vertebrate herbivory may constrain seedling establishment of these two exotic trees and potentially impede the invasion. However, the importance of herbivory in controlling exotic species may vary depending on the vegetation and habitat conditions in some species such as E. globulus. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The movement of species from their native ranges to alien environments is a serious threat to biological diversity. The number of individuals involved in an invasion provides a strong theoretical basis for determining the likelihood of establishment of an alien species. 2. Here a field experiment was used to manipulate the critical first stages of the invasion of an alien insect, a psyllid weed biocontrol agent, Arytainilla spartiophila Forster, in New Zealand and to observe the progress of the invasion over the following 6 years. 3. Fifty-five releases were made along a linear transect 135 km long: 10 releases of two, four, 10, 30 and 90 psyllids and five releases of 270 psyllids. Six years after their original release, psyllids were present in 22 of the 55 release sites. Analysis by logistic regression showed that the probability of establishment was significantly and positively related to initial release size, but that this effect was important only during the psyllids' first year in the field. 4. Although less likely to establish, some of the releases of two and four psyllids did survive 5 years in the field. Overall, releases that survived their first year had a 96% chance of surviving thereafter, providing the release site remained secure. The probability of colony loss due to site destruction remained the same throughout the experiment, whereas the probability of natural extinction reduced steeply over time. 5. During the first year colonies were undergoing a process of establishment and, in most cases, population size decreased. After this first year, a period of exponential growth ensued. 6. A lag period was observed before the populations increased dramatically in size. This was thought to be due to inherent lags caused by the nature of population growth, which causes the smaller releases to appear to have a longer lag period."

Here, we tested whether these enemies have significant impacts on the performance of this plant in its native range. We excluded enemies from the three principal life-history stages (seed, seedling, and adult) of this annual in a series of field experiments; at the adult stage, we also manipulated soil disturbance and conspecific density. We then measured the consequences of these treatments for growth, survival, and reproduction. Excluding fungi and vertebrate granivores from seeds on the soil surface did not increase germination relative to control plots. Seedling survivorship was only slightly increased by the exclusion of molluscs and other herbivores. Insecticide reduced damage to leaves of adult plants, but did not improve growth or reproduction. Growth and survivorship of adults were strongly increased by disturbance, while higher conspecific density reduced performance in disturbed plots. These results indicate ragweed is insensitive to attack by many of its natural enemies, helping to explain its native-range success. In addition, they suggest that even though ragweed lost most of its insect folivores while invading Europe, escape from these enemies is unlikely to have provided a significant demographic advantage; instead, disturbance is likely to have been a much more important factor in its invasion. Escape from enemies should not be assumed to explain the success of exotic species unless improved performance also can be demonstrated; native-range studies can help achieve this goal."

In these forests, one of their primary prey species - introduced house mice (Mus musculus), fluctuate dramatically between years, driven by the irregular heavy seed-fall (masting) of the beech trees. We examined the effects of mice on stoats in this system by comparing the weights, age structure and population densities of stoats caught on two large islands in Fiordland, New Zealand - one that has mice (Resolution Island) and one that does not (Secretary Island). On Resolution Island, the stoat population showed a history of recruitment spikes and troughs linked to beech masting, whereas the Secretary Island population had more constant recruitment, indicating that rodents are probably the primary cause for the boom and bust' population cycle of stoats in beech forests. Resolutions Island stoats were 10% heavier on average than Secretary Island stoats, supporting the hypothesis that the availability of larger prey (mice verses wet) leads to larger stoats. Beech masting years on this island were also correlated with a higher weight for stoats born in the year of the masting event. The detailed demographic information on the stoat populations of these two islands supports previously suggested interactions among mice, stoats and beech masting. These interactions may have important consequences for the endemic species that interact with fluctuating populations of mice and stoats."

This task requires the generation of extremely strong forces, among the strongest forces measured for any animal in any activity. Laboratory studies have shown that claw strength in crabs can respond plastically to, and thereby potentially match, the strength of their prey's defensive armor. These results suggest that claw strength may be variable among natural populations of crabs. However, very few studies have investigated spatial variation in claw strength and related morphometric traits in crabs. Using three geographically separate populations of the invasive green crab in the Gulf of Maine, we demonstrate, for the first time, geographic variation in directly measured claw crushing forces in a brachyuran. Despite variation in mean claw strength however, the scaling of claw crushing force with claw size was consistent among populations. We found that measurements of crushing force were obtained with low error and were highly repeatable for individual crabs. We also show that claw mass, independent of a linear measure of claw size, and carapace color, which is an indicator of time spent in the intermoult, were important predictors of claw crushing force.

Habitat disturbance such as floods, fires and tree-falls may make ecosystems more prone to invasion. However, in this study the absence of fire was considered to be a factor in facilitating the invasion potential of a Madagascan endemic, Bryophyllum delagoense. Fire trials in South Africa killed 89 and 45% of B. delagoense plants in a high and low intensity controlled fire, respectively, with tall plants and those growing in clumps more likely to escape being killed. A reduction in the incidence and intensity of fires may therefore facilitate the invasion of B. delagoense and contribute to its invasive potential. Overgrazing, which reduces the frequency and intensity of fires probably facilitates the invasion of large and small succulent species. In South Africa, B. delagoense is still considered to be a minor weed or garden escape, despite its introduction to southern Africa 175 years earlier than in Australia, where it is extremely invasive. However, other succulents such as Opuntia species have become invasive on both continents, confounding our hypothesis that fire may be inhibiting B. delagoense from becoming invasive in southern Africa. However, closer analysis of Opuntia literature indicates that smaller species, similar in size to B. delagoense, are more likely to be killed, even by low intensity fires.

Previously, it exhibited active preferences for habitats associated with another Ponto-Caspian alien, zebra mussel. Now we tested gammarid preferences for living mussels and their empty shells with biofilm and/or periostracum present or absent, to find the exact cues driving gammarid responses. We observed a strong preference of gammarids for biofilmed shells, even if the biofilm was relatively young (2-day old). However, the biofilm quality, related to the substratum on which it had developed (shells with or without the periostracum, or coated with nail varnish) did not affect their behaviour. In the absence of biofilm, gammarids positively responded to the shell periostracum. Furthermore, they clearly preferred living zebra mussels over old empty shells, independent of the presence or absence of biofilm, confirming the importance of a periostracum-associated cue in their substratum recognition. On the other hand, shells obtained shortly after mussels' death were preferred over living bivalves. Thus, the attractant is associated with fresh mussel shells, rather than with living mussels themselves. The ability of alien gammarids to locate sites inhabited by zebra mussels may contribute to their invasion success in novel areas inhabited by this habitat-forming bivalve."

However, because differences in the extent of invasion may simply result from variation in propagule supply among recipient environments, true comparisons of invasibility require that both invasion success and propagule pressure are quantified. In this study, we quantified propagule pressure in order to compare the invasibility of riparian and upland forests and assess the accuracy of using a community's level of invasion as a surrogate for its invasibility. We found the extent of invasion to be a poor proxy for invasibility. The higher level of invasion in the studied riparian forests resulted from greater propagule availability rather than higher invasibility. Furthermore, failure to account for propagule pressure may confound our understanding of general invasion theories. Ecological theory suggests that species-rich communities should be less invasible. However, we found significant relationships between species diversity and invasion extent, but no diversity-invasibility relationship was detected for any species. Our results demonstrate that using a community's level of invasion as a surrogate for its invasibility can confound our understanding of invasibility and its determinants."

We tested these hypotheses by investigating distribution of the nonindigenous amphipod, Echinogammarus ischnus Stebbing, 1899, in co-occurrence with a widespread amphipod, Gammarus fasciatus Say, 1818, at 97 sites across the Laurentian Great Lakes coastal margins influenced by varying types and levels of anthropogenic stress. E. Ischnus was distributed independently of disturbance gradients related to six anthropogenic disturbance variables that summarized overall nutrient input, nitrogen, and phosphorus load carried from the adjacent coastal watershed, agricultural land area, human population density, overall pollution loading, and the site-specific dominant stressor, consistent with the expectations of regulation by general environmental characteristics.

There exists a paucity of knowledge, however, regarding how intraspecific, or genetic diversity, may covary with other important factors such as propagule pressure. A combination of theoretical modelling and experimentation was used to explore the way propagule pressure and genetic richness may interact. We compare colonization rates of the Australian bivalve Saccostrea glomerata (Gould 1885). We cross propagule size and genetic richness in a factorial design in order to examine the generalities of our theoretical model. Modelling showed that diversity and propagule pressure should generally interact synergistically when positive feedbacks occur (e.g. aggregation). The strength of genotype effects depended on propagule size, or the numerical abundance of arriving individuals. When propagule size was very small (<4 individuals), however, greater genetic richness unexpectedly reduced colonization. The probability of S.glomerata colonization was 76% in genetically rich, larger propagules, almost 39 percentage points higher than in genetically poor propagules of similar size. This pattern was not observed in less dense, smaller propagules. We predict that density-dependent interactions between larvae in the water column may explain this pattern."

Introduced into Lake Naivasha (Kenya) in 1929, their current population abundance is significantly depressed in a lake that has recently become dominated by fishes of the Cyprinidae family; the introduced cyprinid Cyprinus carpio now dominates catches in the commercial fishery and Barbus paludinous is now numerically dominant in the fish community. Long-term diet studies of M. salmoides based on gut contents analysis (GCA) have defined their diet spectrum, feeding preferences and ontogenetic dietary shifts. Between 1987 and 1991, diet was size-structured; fish <260mm were mainly insectivorous and fish >260mm fed mainly on invasive crayfish Procambarus clarkia with B. paludinosus rarely taken. More recent GCA data revealed that up to 2003, these size-structured trophic relationships were still evident, but there has been a subsequent shift to their feeding almost exclusively on small (<100mm) B. paludinosus, coincident with a size-related functional switch whereby M. salmoides >120mm were now piscivorous. However, a Bayesian stable isotope mixing model (SIAR) suggested M. salmoides diet actually remained relatively varied in 2006 and 2007; it indicated P. clarkii were still contributing more to their diet than B. paludinosus in fish <260mm and provided only partial support for the functional shift. The consequence of the M. salmoides depressed population abundance is their predation pressure on prey fishes is limited and preventing top-down effects.

The European common periwinkle, Littorina littorea, was recently introduced to the Pacific coast of Canada and provides a case study of an introduction into an area with an important predator guild (sea stars) that is functionally minor in the invader's native habitat. Here, we assess the likelihood of establishment, spread, and negative ecological impact of this introduced gastropod, with an emphasis on the role of native sea stars as agents of biotic resistance. Size frequency distributions and local market availability suggest that L. littorea was most likely introduced via the live seafood trade. Non-native hitchhikers (e.g., the trematode Cryptocotyle lingua) were found on/in both market and field specimens. Laboratory studies and field observations confirmed that L. littorea can survive seasonal low salinity in Vancouver, British Columbia. Periwinkles also readily consumed native Ulva, suggesting that periwinkles could impact native communities via herbivory or resource competition. Unlike native gastropods, however, L. littorea lacked behavioural avoidance responses to Northeast Pacific predatory sea stars (Pisaster ochraceus and Pycnopodia helianthoides), and sea star predation rates on L. littorea were much higher than predation rates on native turban snails (Chlorostoma funebralis) in common garden experiments. We therefore expect periwinkle establishment in British Columbia to be limited to areas with low predator density, as is seen in its field distribution to date. We caution that this conclusion may understate the importance of the L. littorea introduction if it also serves as a vector for additional non-indigenous species such as C. lingua."

However, few studies have tested this assumption by comparing the performance of invasive species in their native vs. introduced ranges. Here, we studied abundance, growth, reproduction, and herbivory in 10 native Chinese and 10 invasive German populations of the invasive shrub Buddleja davidii (Scrophulariaceae; butterfly bush). We found strong evidence for increased plant vigour in the introduced range: plants in invasive populations were significantly taller and had thicker stems, larger inflorescences, and heavier seeds than plants in native populations. These differences in plant performance could not be explained by a more benign climate in the introduced range. Since leaf herbivory was substantially reduced in invasive populations, our data rather suggest that escape from natural enemies, associated with increased plant growth and reproduction, contributes to the invasion success of B. davidii in Central Europe."

Here, we use data on the occurrence of exotic bird species across oceanic islands worldwide to demonstrate an alternative and previously untested hypothesis that these distributional patterns are a simple consequence of where humans have released such species, and hence of the number of species released. Location Islands around the world. Methods Statistical analysis of published information on the numbers of exotic bird species introduced to, and established on, islands around the world. Results Established exotic birds showed very similar species-area relationships to native species, but different species-isolation relationships. However, in both cases the relationship for established exotics simply mimicked that for the number of exotic bird species introduced. Exotic bird introductions scaled positively with human population size and island isolation, and islands that had seen more native species extinctions had had more exotic species released. Main conclusion The island biogeography of exotic birds is primarily a consequence of human, rather than natural, processes."

We varied the countries included in the regression tree analyses, in order to explore whether certain outliers were biasing the results, and in most of the cases, merchandise imports was the most important explanatory variable.

This is clearly not the case for state, regional or national floras in the USA where colonization (i.e. invasion by exotic species) exceeds extirpation by roughly a 24 to 1 margin. We report an alarming temporal trend in plant invasions in the Pacific Northwest over the past 100 years whereby counties highest in native species richness appear increasingly invaded over time. Despite the possibility of some increased awareness and reporting of native and exotic plant species in recent decades, historical records show a significant, consistent long-term increase in exotic species (number and frequency) at county, state and regional scales in the Pacific Northwest. Here, as in other regions of the country, colonization rates by exotic species are high and extirpation rates are negligible. The rates of species accumulation in space in multi-scale vegetation plots may provide some clues to the mechanisms of the invasion process from local to national scales."

Ecological theory suggests two main possible answers for this paradox: competitive superiority of exotic species over native species and opportunistic use of ecological opportunities derived from human activities. We tested these hypotheses in birds combining field observations and experiments along gradients of urbanization in New South Wales (Australia). Five exotic species attained densities in the study area comparable to those of the most abundant native species, and hence provided a case for the invasion paradox. The success of these alien birds was not primarily associated with a competitive superiority over native species: the most successful invaders were smaller and less aggressive than their main native competitors, and were generally excluded from artificially created food patches where competition was high. More importantly, exotic birds were primarily restricted to urban environments, where the diversity and abundance of native species were low. This finding agrees with previous studies and indicates that exotic and native species rarely interact in nature. Observations and experiments in the field revealed that the few native species that exploit the most urbanized environments tended to be opportunistic foragers, adaptations that should facilitate survival in places where disturbances by humans are frequent and natural vegetation has been replaced by man-made structures. Successful invaders also shared these features, suggesting that their success is not a paradox but can be explained by their capacity to exploit ecological opportunities that most native species rarely use."

Location Eucalyptus groves within Santa Cruz, California. Methods We compared bird diversity and abundance between a eucalyptus grove infested with lerp psyllids and a grove that was uninfested, using point counts. We documented shifts in the foraging behaviour of birds between the groves using structured behavioural observations. Additionally, we judged the effect of bird foraging on lerp psyllid abundance using exclosure experiments. Results We found a greater richness and abundance of Californian birds within a psyllid infested eucalyptus grove compared to a matched non-infested grove, and that Californian birds modify their foraging behaviour within the infested grove in order to concentrate on ingesting psyllids. This suggests that Californian birds could provide indirect top-down benefits to eucalyptus trees similar to those observed in Australia. However, using bird exclosure experiments, we found no evidence of top-down control of lerp psyllids by Californian birds. Main conclusions We suggest that physiological and foraging differences between Californian and Australian pysllid-eating birds account for the failure to observe top-down control of psyllid populations in California. The increasing rate of non-indigenous species invasions has produced local biotas that are almost entirely composed of non-indigenous species. This example illustrates the complex nature of cosmopolitan native-exotic food webs, and the ecological insights obtainable through their study."

How it was introduced into the British Isles is not known, but like many invasive species, it is suspected that it was introduced by humans and was associated with the trade between New Zealand and Britain. Once established in Britain it found in the large, readily available earthworm population a niche that it could exploit. The microclimate of the forests in the center and south of the South Island of New Zealand from whence the flatworm came is similar to that in parts of the British Isles and consequently conducive to its survival. Although when compared with many other invertebrate introductions (e.g., insects) the flatworm's rate of increase has been slow, a retrospective study strongly suggested that, in Scotland, they spread from botanic gardens to horticultural wholesalers, then to domestic gardens, and only latterly did they invade agricultural land. As with other invasive species, the application of the CLIMEX computer model and geographic-information-system techniques have been used to try to ascertain its potential distribution within both the British Isles and Europe. The data suggest that A. triangulatus could become established in northwest continental Europe, and Denmark, Iceland, and Sweden have added it to their quarantine pest lists. The fact that A. triangulatus is the only one of 12 alien terrestrial planarians in Britain to be considered a pest suggests that this group of invertebrates is behaving in a fashion similar to other invasive organisms and obeys the ""tens rule"" suggested by M.

We developed structural equation models (SEMs) to evaluate their relative contribution to promote invasiveness in plants along resource gradients. We compared 20 invasivenative phylogenetically and ecologically related pairs. SEMs included one morphological (root-to-shoot ratio (R/S)) and one physiological (photosynthesis nitrogen-use efficiency (PNUE)) trait, their plasticities in response to nutrient and light variation, and phenotypic integration among 31 traits. Additionally, these components were related to two fitness estimators, biomass and survival. The relative contributions of traits, plasticity and integration were similar in invasive and native species. Trait means were more important than plasticity and integration for fitness. Invasive species showed higher fitness than natives because: they had lower R/S and higher PNUE values across gradients; their higher PNUE plasticity positively influenced biomass and thus survival; and they offset more the cases where plasticity and integration had a negative direct effect on fitness. Our results suggest that invasiveness is promoted by higher values in the fitness hierarchy -- trait means are more important than trait plasticity, and plasticity is similar to integration -- rather than by a specific combination of the three components of the functional strategy."

I performed an experiment to determine how similarity between seed source and transplant site latitude, as a general indicator of pre-adaptation to climate, interacts with propagule pressure (100, 200 and 400 seeds/pot) to influence early colonization success of the widespread North American weed, St. John's wort Hypericum perforatum. Seeds originating from seven native European source populations were sown in pots buried in the ground in a field in western Montana. Seed source populations were either similar or divergent in latitude to the recipient transplant site. Across seed density treatments, the match between seed source and recipient latitude did not affect the proportion of pots colonized or the number of individual colonists per pot. In contrast, propagule pressure had a significant and positive effect on colonization. These results suggest that propagules from many climatically divergent source populations can be viable invaders."

Vegetation changes through time were investigated in four sandy coastal habitats, using a fine-scale diachronic approach that compared vegetation data collected by use of the same procedure, in four time periods, from the 1950s to 2011. Our analysis revealed an overall significant decline of species richness over the last six decades. Further, both the average number of species per plot and the mean focal species proportion were proved to be negatively affected by the increasing proportion of alien species at plot level. The severity of the impact, however, was found to be determined by a combination of species attributes, habitat properties, and human disturbance suggesting that alien species should be referred to as ""passengers"" and not as ""drivers"" of ecosystem change. Passenger alien species are those which take advantage of disturbances or other changes to which they are adapted but that lead to a decline in native biodiversity. Their spread is facilitated by widespread anthropogenic environmental alterations, which create new, suitable habitats, and ensure human-assisted dispersal, reducing the distinctiveness of plant communities and inducing a process of biotic homogenization."

We studied the correlation between alien weeds and native species, dividing the latter group into weedy and non-weedy species, integrating various factors that influence diversity into an analysis on the scale of the federal states of Mexico. The resulting multiple-regression models for native and alien weed species are robust (adjusted R-2 = 0.87 and R-2 = 0.69, respectively) and show a strong partial correlation of the number of weed species (native and alien) with the number of non-weed native species. These results agree with studies showing a positive correlation between the number of native and alien species on larger scales. Both models also include human population density as an important predictor variable, but this is more important for alien weeds (beta = 0.62) than for native weeds (beta = 0.32). In the regression model for native weed species richness, the non-cultivated (fallow) area (beta = 0.24) correlated positively with native weed richness. In the model for alien weed species richness, the native weed species richness was an important variable (beta = -0.51), showing a negative partial correlation (r(part) = -0.4).

Our data revealed no significant difference in herbivore density (excluding A.dispersus) between related native and exotic plants, which suggests that the exotic plants do not benefit from 'enemy release'. There were also no differences in predator density, or combined species richness between native and exotic plants. Together these data suggest that 'biotic resistance' to invasion is also unlikely. Despite the apparent lack of differences in community structure significantly fewer A.dispersus egg spirals and pupae were found on the native plants than on the exotic plants. Additional data on A.dispersus density were collected on Cousin Island, a managed nature reserve in which exotic plants are carefully controlled. Significantly higher densities of A.dispersus were observed on Mahe, where exotic plants are abundant, than on Cousin. These data suggest that the rapid invasion of Seychelles by A.dispersus may largely be due to the high proportion of plant species that are both exotic and hosts of A.dispersus; no support was found for either the 'enemy release' or the 'biotic resistance' hypotheses."

Here, the genetic and phenotypic traits of Japanese populations were examined, together with 11 native populations of the USA using 10 microsatellite markers and six meristic traits. Phylogenetic analysis reconfirmed a single origin of Japanese populations, among which populations established in the 1960s were genetically close to Guttenberg population, keeping high genetic diversity comparable to the ancestral population. In contrast, genetic diversity of later-established populations significantly declined with genetic divergence from the ancestral population. Among the 1960s established populations, that from Lake Biwa showed a significant isolation-by-distance pattern with surrounding populations in which genetic bottlenecks increased with geographical distance from Lake Biwa. Although phenotypic divergence among populations was recognized in both neutral and adaptive traits, P-ST-F-ST comparisons showed that it is independent of neutral genetic divergence. Divergent selection was suggested in some populations from reservoirs with unstable habitats, while stabilizing selection was dominant. Accordingly, many Japanese populations of L. macrochirus appear to have derived from Lake Biwa population, expanding their distribution with population bottlenecks. Despite low propagule pressure, the invasion success of L. macrochirus is probably because of its drastic population growth in Lake Biwa shortly after its introduction, together with artificial transplantations. It not only enabled the avoidance of a loss in genetic diversity but also formed a major gene pool that supported local adaptation with high phenotypic plasticity."

Addressing the role of genetic diversity in plant invasion experimentally requires its manipulation independent of propagule pressure. To assess the relative importance of these components for the invasion of Senecio vernalis, we created propagule mixtures of four levels of genotype diversity by combining seeds across remote populations, across proximate populations, within single populations and within seed families. In a first container experiment with constant Festuca rupicola density as matrix, genotype diversity was crossed with three levels of seed density. In a second experiment, we tested for effects of establishment limitation and genotype diversity by manipulating Festuca densities. Increasing genetic diversity had no effects on abundance and biomass of S. vernalis but positively affected the proportion of large individuals to small individuals. Mixtures composed from proximate populations had a significantly higher proportion of large individuals than mixtures composed from within seed families only. High propagule pressure increased emergence and establishment of S. vernalis but had no effect on individual growth performance. Establishment was favoured in containers with Festuca, but performance of surviving seedlings was higher in open soil treatments. For S. vernalis invasion, we found a shift in driving factors from density dependence to effects of genetic diversity across life stages. While initial abundance was mostly linked to the amount of seed input, genetic diversity, in contrast, affected later stages of colonization probably via sampling effects and seemed to contribute to filtering the genotypes that finally grew up. In consequence, when disentangling the mechanistic relationships of genetic diversity, seed density and microsite limitation in colonization of invasive plants, a clear differentiation between initial emergence and subsequent survival to juvenile and adult stages is required."

In 2009, we conducted a companion fertilization experiment to investigate how various forms of N deposition (inorganic and organic) influenced native and non-native species richness and diversity. We found that native species richness and diversity were negatively correlated with 1) non-native species richness and diversity and 2) higher total soil inorganic N. In the deposition experiment, adding organic N fertilizers decreased native richness and diversity compared to inorganic N fertilizers. Together, these results indicate that increasing soil N can be detrimental to native species; however, native species richness and diversity may counteract the N-stimulation of non-native species.

We used results from our best model to compile a spreadsheet-based model for easy use and interpretation. Probability scores obtained from the spreadsheet model were strongly correlated with establishment success as were probabilities predicted for independent data by the boosted regression tree model. However, the error rate for predictions made with independent data was much higher than with cross validation using training data. This difference in predictive power does not preclude use of the model to assess the probability of establishment of herpetofauna because (1) the independent data had no information for two variables (meaning the full predictive capacity of the model could not be realized) and (2) the model structure is consistent with the recent literature on the primary determinants of establishment success for herpetofauna. It may still be difficult to predict the establishment probability of poorly studied taxa, but it is clear that non-native species (especially lizards and frogs) that mature early and come from environments similar to that of the introduction region have the highest probability of establishment."

Ecologically important ""foundation"" species, Zostera marina and other seagrasses have globally declined during the past century. This study used transplant and vegetation removal experiments to test the hypotheses that disturbance and competitive interactions with an invasive congener (Z. japonica) are contributing to the decline of native Z. marina in the northeastern Pacific. Interspecific competition reduced Z. marina and Z. japonica above-ground biomass by 44 and 96%, respectively, relative to intraspecific competition. Disturbance substantially enhanced Z. japonica productivity and fitness, and concomitantly decreased Z. marina performance, effects that persisted two years following substratum disturbance. These results demonstrate that disturbance and competitive interactions with Z. japonica reduce Z. marina performance, and suggest that Z. japonica's success as an invasive species stems dually from its ability to persist in competition with Z. marina and its positive response to disturbance. These results highlight the importance of understanding the interconnected roles of species interactions and disturbance in the decline of seagrass habitats, and provide a rationale for amending conservation policy in Washington State. In the interest of conserving native eelgrass populations, the current policy of protecting both native and invasive Zostera spp. should be refined to differentiate between native and invader, and to rescind the protection of invasive eelgrass."

Alien plant invasions are one of the biggest threats facing remaining natural areas on the Cape Peninsula, South Africa. The area provides an ideal opportunity to study the dynamics of invasions at the urban/wildland interface, since the largest natural area, the Table Mountain National Park (TMNP), is surrounded by the city of Cape Town. We explored invasion patterns in Newlands Forest (a small section of the TMNP) and detailed the roles of habitat features and distance from putative source populations in three main habitat types: natural Afromontane forest, riverine woodland habitats, and plantations of exotic pines (Pinus radiata and P. pinaster). We also examined the role of disturbance in driving invasions in two of these habitat types (Afromontane forest and pine plantations).

Wildfire is a major driver of the structure and function of mallee eucalypt-and spinifex-dominated landscapes. Understanding how fire influences the distribution of biota in these fire-prone environments is essential for effective ecological and conservation-based management. Aims. We aimed to (1) determine the effects of an extensive wildfire (118 000 ha) on a small mammal community in the mallee shrublands of semiarid Australia and (2) assess the hypothesis that the fire-response patterns of small mammals can be predicted by their life-history characteristics. Methods. Small-mammal surveys were undertaken concurrently at 26 sites: once before the fire and on four occasions following the fire (including 14 sites that remained unburnt). We documented changes in small-mammal occurrence before and after the fire, and compared burnt and unburnt sites. In addition, key components of vegetation structure were assessed at each site. Key results. Wildfire had a strong influence on vegetation structure and on the occurrence of small mammals. The mallee ningaui, Ningaui yvonneae, a dasyurid marsupial, showed a marked decline in the immediate post-fire environment, corresponding with a reduction in hummock-grass cover in recently burnt vegetation. Species richness of native small mammals was positively associated with unburnt vegetation, although some species showed no clear response to wildfire. Conclusions. Our results are consistent with the contention that mammal responses to fire are associated with their known life-history traits. The species most strongly affected by wildfire, N. yvonneae, has the most specific habitat requirements and restricted life history of the small mammals in the study area. The only species positively associated with recently burnt vegetation, the introduced house mouse, Mus domesticus, has a flexible life history and non-specialised resource requirements. Implications. Maintaining sources for recolonisation after large-scale wildfires will be vital to the conservation of native small mammals in mallee ecosystems."

Because its genetic variation is very low, phenotypic plasticity is believed to be the primary strategy for adapting to the diverse habitats. In the present paper, we investigated the plastic changes of anatomical traits of the aerial parts of A. philoxeroides from flooding to wet then to drought habitat; the results are as follows: A. philoxeroides could change anatomical structures sensitively to adapt to water regime. As a whole, effects of water regime on structures in stem were greater than those in leaf. Except for principal vein diameter and stoma density on leaf surfaces, all other structural traits were significantly affected by water regime. Among which, cuticular wax layer, collenchyma cell wall, phloem fiber cell wall, and hair density on both leaf surfaces thickened significantly with decrease of water availability, whereas, pith cavity and vessel lumen in stem lessened significantly; wet habitat is vital for the spread of A. philoxeroides from flooding to drought habitat and vice versa, because in this habitat, it had the greatest structural variations; when switching from flooding to wet then to drought habitat, the variations of cuticular wax layer, collenchyma cell wall, phloem fiber cell wall, pith cavity area ratio, diameter of vessel lumen, and hair density on both leaf surfaces, played the most important role. These responsive variables contribute most to the adaptation of A. philoxeroides to diverse habitats with considerably various water availability."

It has established breeding populations and has been spreading, yet information on its dietary preferences in New Zealand are unknown. We conducted field caging experiments to elucidate prey choices and potential impacts of Charybdis on benthic communities. We tested the hypothesis that Charybdis would reduce the previously demonstrated positive influence of native pinnid bivalves, Atrina zelandica, on the abundance and richness of surrounding soft-sediment macrofauna. Adult male Charybdis were introduced to cages with and without Atrina that included soft-sediment macrofaunal communities of ambient composition and abundance. After leaving the crabs to feed overnight, changes in community structure (relative to sediments without crabs) were determined by coring the sediment and analysing the resident macrofauna. Prey choices were verified by extracting taxa from the stomachs of crabs collected from the cages in which they had been feeding. The abundance of large taxa including burrowing urchins, bivalves and native crabs was lower in the presence of Charybdis compared to areas without this invader. The stomach contents of Charybdis were dominated by these same three taxa, constituting 85 % of the prey abundance when using stomach fullness as a weighting factor. Our hypothesis was supported with the greatest net losses occurring in cages with Charybdis and Atrina. Reduction in the abundance of Echinocardium cordatum by Charybdis could have cascading ecological effects, as these urchins play a critical role in benthic soft-sediment ecosystems in New Zealand via bioturbation and biogenic disturbance."

Location New Zealand. Methods We used spatial, temporal and habitat information taken from 9297 herbarium records of 301 alien plant species to examine the vulnerability of 11 terrestrial habitats to plant invasions. A null model that randomized species records across habitats was used to account for variation in sampling effort and to derive a relative measure of invasion based either on all records for a species or only its first record. The relative level of invasion was related to the average distance of each habitat from the nearest conurbation, which was used as a proxy for propagule pressure. The habitat in which a species was first recorded was compared to the habitats encountered for all records of that species to determine whether the initial habitat could predict subsequent habitat occupancy. Results Variation in sampling effort in space and time significantly masked the underlying vulnerability of habitats to plant invasions. Distance from the nearest conurbation had little effect on the relative level of invasion in each habitat, but the number of first records of each species significantly declined with increasing distance. While Urban, Streamside and Coastal habitats were over-represented as sites of initial invasion, there was no evidence of major invasion hotspots from which alien plants might subsequently spread. Rather, the data suggest that certain habitats (especially Roadsides) readily accumulate alien plants from other habitats. Main conclusions Herbarium records combined with a suitable null model provide a powerful tool for assessing the relative vulnerability of habitats to plant invasion. The first records of alien plants tend to be found near conurbations, but this pattern disappears with subsequent spread. Regardless of the habitat where a species was first recorded, ultimately most alien plants spread to Roadside and Sparse habitats. This information suggests that such habitats may be useful targets for weed surveillance and monitoring."

Thus, there is an increased interest in understanding the effects of changes in means and variances of temperature on traits of climatic stress resistance. Here, we examined short-term (within-generation) variation in mean temperature (23, 25, and 27 degrees C) at three levels of diel thermal fluctuations (delta = 1, 3, or 5 degrees C) on an invasive pest insect, the Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann) (Diptera: Tephritidae). Using the adult flies, we address the hypothesis that temperature variability may affect the climatic stress resistance over and above changes in mean temperature at constant variability levels. We scored the traits of high- and low-thermal tolerance, high- and low-temperature acute hardening ability, water balance, and egg production under benign conditions after exposure to each of the nine experimental scenarios. Most importantly, results showed that temperature variance may have significant effects in addition to the changes in mean temperature for most traits scored. Although typical acclimation responses were detected for most of the traits under low variance conditions, high variance scenarios dramatically altered the outcomes, with poorer climatic stress resistance detected in some, but not all, traits. These results suggest that large temperature fluctuations might limit plastic responses which in turn could reduce the insect fitness. Increased mean temperatures in conjunction with increased temperature variability may therefore have stronger negative effects on this agricultural pest than elevated temperatures alone. The results of this study therefore have significant implications for understanding insect responses to climate change and suggest that analyses or simulations of only mean temperature variation may be inappropriate for predicting population-level responses under future climate change scenarios despite their widespread use."

Lag phases between the first release for cultivation and the beginning of spontaneous spread were reconstructed for 184 species. On average, there was a time lag of 147 years between the introduction to Brandenburg and the initiation of invasion (170 years for trees, 131 for shrubs). The first occurrence of a seedling in the area was defined as the start of a biological invasion without regard to the subsequent success or failure of this invasion. Species' success and failure were evaluated in terms of naturalization and frequency of the 3150 woody species introduced to Germany. It was established that successful invaders are not necessarily quicker in starting invasions and that less than 10% of the introduced species begin to invade, 2% become established, and 1% may successfully invade natural vegetation. When applying this 10:2=1 rule to assess the invasion risk, is has to be considered that the ration between introductions and starting invasions is not constant, but has increased through time: in 1780 only about 3% of the introduced species had invaded, compared to 7.4% in 1990. Consequently, the number of invasions breaking out will still increase, even if no additional species are introduced. The analysis of timing of biological invasions cannot be explained sufficiently by deterministic factors referring to species' life history. As discussed for some species, the successful invasion can be due to an interaction of directional climatic changes (rising temperatures since 1850) and of stochastically induced shifts in the availability and accessibility of safe sites."

In 1983 the ground layer of half of each station on the spoil ridge and on the 'flat' near the ridge were dominated by English ivy; other stations were ivy-free. By 1989 English ivy had invaded four of the ivy-free stations. This increase in ivy abundance was not statistically significant on the 'flat' but was significant (2 (Y, 1df), p<0.1) on the ridge. There was no significant difference (2 (Y, 1df), p>0.1) between ivy rooting depth on the sewer ridge and on the flat, indicating that good soil conditions were present in both places.

This hybrid zone is a complex system where multiple effects such as inter-species competition, bi-directional introgression, strong environmental pressure and so on are combined. Why do sympatric Chondrostoma fish present a unidirectional change in body shape? Is this the result of inter-species interactions and/or a response to environmental effects or the result of trade-offs? Studies focusing on the understanding of a trade-off between multiple parameters are still rare. Although this has previously been done for Cichlid species flock and for Darwin finches, where mouth or beak morphology were coupled to diet and genetic identification, no similar studies have been done for a fish hybrid zone in a river. We tested the correlation between morphology (body and mouth morphology), diet ( stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes) and genomic combinations in different allopatric and sympatric populations for a global data set of 1330 specimens. To separate the species interaction effect from the environmental effect in sympatry, we distinguished two data sets: the first one was obtained from a highly regulated part of the river and the second was obtained from specimens coming from the less regulated part. Results: The distribution of the hybrid combinations was different in the two part of the sympatric zone, whereas all the specimens presented similar overall changes in body shape and in mouth morphology. Sympatric specimens were also characterized by a larger diet behavior variance than reference populations, characteristic of an opportunistic diet. No correlation was established between the body shape (or mouth deformation) and the stable isotope signature. Conclusion: The Durance River is an untamed Mediterranean river despite the presence of numerous dams that split the river from upstream to downstream. The sympatric effect on morphology and the large diet behavior range can be explained by a tendency toward an opportunistic behavior of the sympatric specimens. Indeed, the similar response of the two species and their hybrids implied an adaptation that could be defined as an alternative trade-off that underline the importance of epigenetics mechanisms for potential success in a novel environment."

Two major hypotheses have been proposed: invasive species have a suite of traits that enhance their performance relative to indigenous ones over a reasonably wide set of circumstances; invasive species have greater phenotypic plasticity than their indigenous counterparts and will be better able to retain performance under altered conditions. Thus, two possibly independent, but complementary mechanistic perspectives can be adopted: based on trait means and on reaction norms. Here, to demonstrate how this approach might be applied to understand interactions between climate change and invasion, we investigate variation in the egg development times and their sensitivity to temperature amongst indigenous and introduced springtail species in a cool temperate ecosystem (Marion Island, 4654'S 3754'E) that is undergoing significant climate change. Generalized linear model analyses of the linear part of the development rate curves revealed significantly higher mean trait values in the invasive species compared to indigenous species, but no significant interactions were found when comparing the thermal reaction norms. In addition, the invasive species had a higher hatching success than the indigenous species at high temperatures. This work demonstrates the value of explicitly examining variation in trait means and reaction norms among indigenous and invasive species to understand the mechanistic basis of variable responses to climate change among these groups.

What type of community can we expect in the future given current or novel conditions? We address these questions by comparing Markov chain community models among treatments from a field experiment on invasive species on Robinson Crusoe Island, Chile. Because of seed dispersal, grazing and disturbance, we predicted that the exotic European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) facilitates epizoochorous exotic plants (plants with seeds that stick to the skin an animal) at the expense of native plants. To test our hypothesis, we crossed rabbit exclosure treatments with disturbance treatments, and sampled the plant community in permanent plots over 3 years. We then estimated Markov chain model transition probabilities and found significant differences among treatments. As hypothesized, this modelling revealed that exotic plants survive better in disturbed areas, while natives prefer no rabbits or disturbance. Surprisingly, rabbits negatively affect epizoochorous plants. Markov chain dynamics indicate that an overall replacement of native plants by exotic plants is underway. Using a treatment-based approach to multi-species Markov chain models allowed us to examine the changes in the importance of mechanisms in response to experimental impacts on communities."

Effects of litter may be modified by activity of ecosystem engineers such as earthworms. We examined the interacting effects of forest litter type and earthworm presence on invasibility of plants into forest floor environments using a greenhouse mesocosm experiment. We crossed five litter treatments mimicking historic and predicted changes in dominant tree composition with a treatment of either the absence or presence of nonnative earthworms. We measured mass loss of each litter type and growth of a model nonnative plant species (Festuca arundinacea, fescue) sown into each mesocosm. Mass loss was greater for litter of tree species characterized by lower C:N ratios. Earthworms enhanced litter mass loss, but only for species with lower C:N, leading to a significant litter x earthworm interaction. Fescue biomass was significantly greater in treatments with litter of low C:N and greater mass loss, suggesting that rapid decomposition of forest litter may be more favorable to understory plant invasions. Earthworms were expected to enhance invasion by increasing mass loss and removing the physical barrier of litter. However, earthworms typically reduced invasion success but not under invasive tree litter where the presence of earthworms facilitated invasion success compared to other litter treatments where earthworms were present. We conclude that past and predicted future shifts in dominant tree species may influence forest understory invasibility. The presence of nonnative earthworms may either suppress of facilitate invasibility depending on the species of dominant overstory tree species and the litter layers they produce."

Using generalized linear mixed models, we tested the effect of wild hog disturbance on permanent sites for yellow nutsedge culm density, tuber density, and percent cover of native plant species over a 12-year period. We found that disturbance plots had a higher number of culms and tubers and a lower percentage of native live plant cover than undisturbed control plots. Wild hogs redisturbed the disturbed plots approximately every 5 years.

Here, we observed differences in above- and below-ground impacts of two invasive woody shrubs, Lonicera maackii and Ligustrum sinense, among plots containing both shrubs (mixed), each species singly or lacking both species (control). We found additive and non-additive effects of these co-occurring invasives on plant communities and soil processes.

Compared to control plots, mixed plots had three times the potential activity of -glucosidase, a carbon-degrading extracellular soil enzyme.

Biogeographical studies that have compared natural enemies in native and introduced ranges have typically focused on a small area of the plants' distributions in each range, only one plant species, and/or only one guild of natural enemies. To test enemy release, we first surveyed both pathogens and herbivores in multiple populations in both the native and naturalized ranges of three commonly co-occurring perennial bunchgrasses introduced to the United States from Europe. We then compared our field results to the number of fungal pathogens that have been documented on each species from published host-pathogen data compilations. Consistent with enemy release, our field survey showed less herbivory and denser populations in the naturalized range, but there was no evidence of release from pathogens. In contrast, the published host-pathogen data compilations produced evidence of enemy release from pathogens. The difference in results produced by the two approaches highlights the need for multiple approaches to testing mechanisms of invasions by introduced species, which can enable well supported theory to inform sound management practices."

Plant populations can respond to environmental heterogeneity via genetic differentiation between large distinct patches, and via phenotypic plasticity in response to heterogeneity occurring at small scales relative to dispersal distance. As a result, the level of environmental heterogeneity experienced across generations, as determined by seed dispersal distance, may itself be under selection. Selection could act to increase or decrease seed dispersal distance, depending on patterns of heterogeneity in environmental quality with distance from a maternal home site. Serpentine soils, which impose harsh and variable abiotic stress on non-adapted plants, have been partially invaded by Erodium cicutarium in northern California, USA. Using nearby grassland sites characterized as either serpentine or non-serpentine, we collected seeds from dense patches of E. cicutarium on both soil types in spring 2004 and subsequently dispersed those seeds to one of four distances from their maternal home site (0, 0.5, 1, or 10 m). We examined distance-dependent patterns of variation in offspring lifetime fitness, conspecific density, soil availability, soil water content, and aboveground grass and forb biomass. ANOVA revealed a distinct. tness peak when seeds were dispersed 0.5 m from their maternal home site on serpentine patches. In non-serpentine patches,. tness was reduced only for seeds placed back into the maternal home site. Conspecific density was uniformly high within 1 m of a maternal home site on both soils, whereas soil water content and grass biomass were significantly heterogeneous among dispersal distances only on serpentine soils. Structural equation modeling and multigroup analysis revealed significantly stronger direct and indirect effects linking abiotic and biotic variation to offspring performance on serpentine soils than on nonserpentine soils, indicating the potential for soil-specific selection on seed dispersal distance in this invasive species."

We assessed differences in understory diversity associated with these treatments. We identified 195 species of understory plants. focusing on the distribution of natives and exotics. The abundance of understory plants was more sensitive to changes in management treatments than the overall species richness. Exotics on the whole, responded statistically more strongly to disturbance treatments than did natives. Both the richness and abundance of exotic forbs increased significantly with treatment intensity. Species richness remained stable while abundance of native graminoids increased significantly with treatment intensity through thinned and burned stands. Both then decreased significantly in stands that experienced wildfire. The number of native shrub species decreased significantly with treatment intensity. Overall plant diversity was least in the unmanaged stands and progressively increased with intensity of disturbance/stand treatments.

Biological invasion can permanently alter ecosystem structure and function. Invasive species are difficult to eradicate, so methods for constraining invasions would be ecologically valuable. We examined the potential of ecological restoration to constrain invasion of an old field by Agropyron cristatum, an introduced C-3 grass. 2. A field experiment was conducted in the northern Great Plains of North America. One-hundred and forty restored plots were planted in 1994-96 with a mixture of C-3 and C-4 native grass seed, while 100 unrestored plots were not. Vegetation on the plots was measured periodically between 1994 and 2002. 3. Agropyron cristatum invaded the old field between 1994 and 2002, occurring in 5% of plots in 1994 and 66% of plots in 2002, and increasing in mean cover from 0.2% in 1994 to 17.1% in 2002. However, A. cristatum invaded one-third fewer restored than unrestored plots between 1997 and 2002, suggesting that restoration constrained invasion. Further, A. cristatum cover in restored plots decreased with increasing planted grass cover. Stepwise regression indicated that A. cristatum cover was more strongly correlated with planted grass cover than with distance from the A. cristatum source, species richness, percentage bare ground or percentage litter. 4. The strength of the negative relationship between A. cristatum and planted native grasses varied among functional groups: the correlation was stronger with species with phenology and physiology similar to A. cristatum (i.e. C-3 grasses) than with dissimilar species (C-4 grasses). 5. Richness and cover of naturally establishing native species decreased with increasing A. cristatum cover. In contrast, restoration had little effect on the establishment and colonization of naturally establishing native species. Thus, A. cristatum hindered colonization by native species while planted native grasses did not. 6. Synthesis and applications. To our knowledge, this study provides the first indication that restoration can act as a filter, constraining invasive species while allowing colonization by native species. These results suggest that resistance to invasion depends on the identity of species in the community and that restoration seed mixes might be tailored to constrain selected invaders. Restoring areas before invasive species become established can reduce the magnitude of biological invasion."

Signatures of parasite release could thus be used to resolve cryptogenic (uncertain) origins such as that of Littorina littorea, a European marine snail whose history in North America has been debated for over 100 years. Through extensive field and literature surveys, we examined species richness of parasitic trematodes infecting this snail and two co-occurring congeners, L. saxatilis and L. obtusata, both considered native throughout the North Atlantic. Of the three snails, only L. littorea possessed significantly fewer trematode species in North America, and all North American trematodes infecting the three Littorina spp. were a nested subset of Europe. Surprisingly, several of L. littorea's missing trematodes in North America infected the other Littorina congeners. Most likely, long separation of these trematodes from their former host resulted in divergence of the parasites' recognition of L. littorea. Overall, these patterns of parasitism suggest a recent invasion from Europe to North America for L. littorea and an older, natural expansion from Europe to North America for L. saxatilis and L. obtusata."

The effects of exclosure on growth rate did not differ between A. platanoides and its native congener. In the understory, exposure to browsing reduced height growth rate overall in native species, but not in invasive species. (4) Browsing increased understory mortality only in the native shrub Viburnum dentatum, and did not affect mortality in the open. Within exclosures, there was a general trade-off between open growth and understory survival, but outside of exclosures, E. umbellata exhibited both greater open growth and greater understory survival than its native competitor. (5) Although large-mammal herbivory did not consistently favor non-natives, lack of browsing impact played an important facilitating role for E. umbellata in particular. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Variation in plasticity of ecologically important traits could facilitate the evolution of greater plasticity and invasiveness. We examined plasticity among invasive populations of Microstegium vimineum (Japanese stiltgrass), a widespread and often dominant grass of forests in the eastern U.S. with two separate experiments. First, we exposed seven Microstegium populations to a drought treatment in growth chambers and monitored growth and physiological responses. Then, we established a greenhouse experiment using a subset of the populations; two that exhibited the most divergent responses and one intermediate population. In the greenhouse, we manipulated drought and shade and evaluated biomass production and specific leaf area (SLA). Microstegium exhibited plasticity for biomass production and SLA in the greenhouse experiment, and populations significantly varied in the degree of plasticity under drought and shade treatments. Two populations significantly increased biomass production under favorable conditions, unlike the third population. The most productive populations also responded to shade stress via greater SLA, possibly allowing for greater utilization of available light, while the third population did not. These results show that Microstegium can exhibit plastic responses to environmental conditions. Moreover, variation for plasticity among populations provides the potential for further evolution of plasticity. Future studies should focus on the relative importance of plasticity for the success of Microstegium and other plant invaders and evaluate post-introduction evolution of plasticity."

So far few data are available on this topic and the results are inconclusive. We compared leaf herbivory between native and invasive woody plants on Mahe, the main island of the tropical Seychelles. We further investigated variation in leaf herbivory on three abundant invasive species along an altitudinal gradient (50-550m a.s.l.). The median percentage of leaves affected by herbivores was significantly higher in native species (50%) than in invasive species (27%). In addition, the species suffering from the highest leaf area loss were native to the Seychelles. These results are consistent with the enemy release hypothesis (ERH). While the invasive species showed significant and mostly consistent variation in the amount of leaf damage between sites, this variation was not related to general altitudinal trends in diversity but rather to local variation in habitat structure and diversity. Our results indicate that in the Seychelles invasive woody plants profit from herbivore release relative to the native species and that the amount of herbivory, and therefore its effect on species invasiveness or habitat invasibility, may be dependent on local community structure and composition."

To evaluate the importance of ecological factors, such as host plant proximity and density, in determining the direction and strength of such herbivore-mediated indirect effects, we quantified oviposition by the exotic weevil Rhinocyllus conicus on the native wavyleaf thistle Cirsium undulatum in midgrass prairie on loam soils in the upper Great Plains, USA. Over three years (2001-2003), the number of eggs laid by R. conicus on C. undulatum always decreased significantly with distance (0-220 m) from a musk thistle ( Carduus nutans L.) patch. Neither the level of R. conicus oviposition on C. undulatum nor the strength of the distance effect was predicted by local musk thistle patch density or by local C. undulatum density ( <= 5 m). The results suggest that high R. conicus egg loads on C. undulatum near musk thistle resulted from the native thistle's co-occurrence with the coevolved preferred exotic host plant and not from the weevil's response to local host plant density. Mean egg loads on C. undulatum also were greater at sites with higher R. conicus densities. We conclude that both preferred-plant proximity and shared herbivore density strongly affected the herbivore-mediated indirect interaction, suggesting that such interactions are important pathways by which invasive exotic weeds can indirectly impact native plants."

Univariate analyses revealed variation in plasticity among populations in the expression of all of the traits measured to at least one of these environmental factors, with the exception of leaf length.

The broad objective of this work was to compare the ability of native and invasive perennial forbs to acquire and use nutrients from nutrient-rich microsites. We evaluated morphological and physiological responses among four native and four invasive species exposed to heterogeneous (patch) or homogeneous (control) nutrient distribution. Invasives, on average, allocated more biomass to roots and allocated proportionately more root length to nutrient-rich microsites than did natives. Invasives also had higher leaf N, photosynthetic rates, and photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency than natives, regardless of treatment. While these results suggest multiple traits may contribute to the success of invasive forbs in low-nutrient environments, we also observed large variation in these traits among native forbs. These observations support the idea that functional trait variation in the plant community may be a better predictor of invasion resistance than the functional group composition of the plant community."

The primary described mechanism of seed dispersal is through consumption of fruits by birds and mammals. We evaluated an alternative dispersal method by evaluating the potential for S. terebinthifolius growing in freshwater and estuarine environments to disperse via water currents. Specifically, we: (1) determined the duration fruits remained buoyant in three salinities, (2) estimated the viability of seeds after 7 days in water, (3) estimated the dispersal rate of floating solitary fruits, and (4) examined the role of boat wakes in moving seeds above mean high water at the shoreline. The length of time fruits floated in 0 ppt water (4.9 days) was significantly less than 15 ppt saltwater (6.2 days), and 30 ppt saltwater (6.9 days). After 7 days, over 13% of seeds remained viable in 0 ppt, 15 ppt, and 30 ppt water. By combining mean dispersal rates and the mean number of days fruits floated, we calculated individual fruits could be transported 16.9 km in 0 ppt and over 22 km in 15 and 30 ppt water. To increase germination, seeds must be stranded above the intertidal zone. Wind wakes alone never achieved this result; however, boat wakes plus wind wakes significantly increased the movement of fruits above the intertidal region into drier soils. The use of both vertebrate dispersal vectors and water dispersal may potentially increase the rate of invasion, establishment, and survival of S. terebinthifolius in freshwater and estuarine environments."

While studies of natural communities generally refute this hypothesis, reporting positive relationships between native species diversity and invasibility, some local-scale studies have instead obtained negative relationships. Most treatments of the topic have failed to recognize that all exotic invaders do not behave alike: while ""weak"" invaders become minor components of communities, ""strong"" invaders become community dominants at the expense of native species. At the same time, the specific impacts of strong invaders on communities are poorly documented yet critical to understanding implications of diversity loss. With these shortfalls in mind, we examined local-scale relationships between native and exotic plant taxa in buncligrass communities of western Montana, USA. We found that measures of native species diversity and invasibility were positively correlated in communities with low levels of invasion where both weak and strong invaders occurred at low densities, but negatively correlated in communities with high levels of invasion where the strong invader Centaurea maculosa dominated. Furthermore, at both low and high levels of invasion, weak invaders tended to vary positively with native species richness while strong invaders varied negatively. Weak invaders determined positive overall relationships between native and exotic species in low invasion communities and appeared to coexist with native taxa. Strong invaders prevailed in high invasion communities, driving negative overall relationships therein. That negative relationships primarily reflected strong invader impacts was supported by the fact that negative correlations of C. maculosa with native species diversity and abundance held when we statistically controlled for levels of native species representing preinvasion conditions. In addition, negative associations of C. maculosa with native taxa varied in strength by functional group and species, with large effects on numerically dominant species, suggesting a dramatic shift in community composition and structure. The distinction between weak and strong invaders is important for reconciling conflicting results from previous studies of natural communities, and moving attention beyond the current debate surrounding the biotic resistance hypothesis."

However, little is known about the demographical strategy of invaders and its plasticity among similar ecosystems. To assess the role of demographical attributes and their interaction with soil and light conditions on the durable integration of an exotic invasive tree species into a recipient forest, we analyzed population structure, sexual and clonal reproduction, and growth characteristics of the American black cherry (Prunus serotina Ehrh.) in a European forest.As seeds, P. serotina is able to enter closed-canopy forests and form a long-living sapling bank, according to the 'Oskar syndrome' (no height growth, diameter increment < 0.06 mm year-1). Suppressed saplings typically develop a 'sit-and-wait' strategy so that the invader had a head start on native species when a disturbance-induced gap occurs. Once released, suppressed saplings grow rapidly (height growth > 56 cm year-1) to reach the canopy, fill in the gap and produce numerous seeds (6011 per tree on average). During the self-thinning process characterizing the aggrading phase, overtopped saplings die back but subsequently resprout from roots and stumps, going back to 'Oskar' stage. This 'Alice behaviour' would enable individuals to decrease in size, delay mortality and locally self-maintain in the understories. These results suggest that P. serotina may successfully invade European forests thanks to a combination of traits which fits well the disturbance regime of the recipient ecosystems. It would behave as a shade-tolerant K-strategist in juvenile stages by giving priority to persistence, but as a light-demanding r-strategist once released, by allocating high energy in growth and reproduction. Initial stages of colonisation are weakly affected by soil but strongly by light conditions."

The traditional explanation for this phenomenon is that natural enemies (e. g., competitors, pathogens, and predators) present in the native range are absent from the introduced range. The purpose of this study was to test the escape-from-enemy hypothesis using the perennial plant Silene latifolia as a model system. This European native was introduced to North America in the 1800s and subsequently spread to a large part of the continent. It is now considered a problematic weed of disturbed habitats and agricultural fields in the United States and Canada. Surveys of 86 populations in the United States and Europe revealed greater levels of attack by generalist enemies (aphids, snails, floral herbivores) in Europe compared with North America. Two specialists (seed predator, anther smut fungus) that had dramatic effects on plant fitness in Europe were either absent or in very low frequency in North America. Overall, plants were 17 times more likely to be damaged in Europe than in North America. Thus, S. latifolia's successful North American invasion can, at least in part, be explained by escape from specialist enemies and lower levels of damage following introduction."

Bullfrogs were more likely to invade farms located on islands with lower native frog species richness than mainland farms, consistent with the biotic resistance hypothesis.

However, because invasive ants reach extraordinary densities at introduced locations, increased feeding efficiency or increased exploitation of new foods should be important in their success. Earlier studies suggest that honeydew produced by Homoptera (e.g., aphids, mealybugs, scale insects) may be important in the diet of the invasive ant species Solenopsis invicta. To determine if this is the case, we studied associations of S. invicta and Homoptera in east Texas and conducted a regional survey for such associations throughout the species' range in the southeast United States. In east Texas, we found that S. invicta tended Ho-moptera extensively and actively constructed shelters around them. The shelters housed a variety of Homoptera whose frequency differed according to either site location or season, presumably because of differences in host plant availability and temperature. Overall, we estimate that the honeydew produced in Homoptera shelters at study sites in east Texas could supply nearly one-half of the daily energetic requirements of an S. invicta colony. Of that, 70% may come from a single species of invasive Homoptera, the mealybug Antonina graminis. Homoptera shelters were also common at regional survey sites and A. graminis occurred in shelters at nine of 11 survey sites. A comparison of shelter densities at survey sites and in east Texas suggests that our results from east Texas could apply throughout the range of S. invicta in the southeast United States. Antonina graminis may be an ex-ceptionally important nutritional resource for S. invicta in the southeast United States. While it remains largely unstudied, the tending of introduced or invasive Homoptera also appears important to other, and perhaps all, invasive ant species. Exploitative or mutually beneficial associations that occur between these insects may be an important, previously unrecognized factor promoting their success."

To explore whether variation in species-specific functional traits pertaining to drought-tolerance exist, we investigated wood anatomical traits of key native riparian species and the invasive Acacia mearnsii across different water availability proxies. Wood density, vessel resistance against implosion, vessel lumen diameter and vessel wall thickness were measured. Wood density varied significantly between species, with A. mearnsii having denser wood at sites in rivers with high discharge. As higher wood density is indicative of increased drought tolerance and typical of drier sites, this counter-intuitive finding suggests that increased wood density was more closely related to midday water stress, than streamflow quantity per se. Wood density was positively correlated with vessel resistance against implosion. Higher wood density may also be evidence that A. mearnsii is more resistant against drought-induced cavitation than the studied native species. The observed plastic response of A. mearnsii anatomical traits to variable water availability indicates the ability of this species to persist under various environmental conditions. A possible non-causal relationship between wood anatomy and drought tolerance in these riparian systems is discussed."

An exception is the incursion of Yellow crazy ant Anoplolepis gracilipes within northeast Arnhem Land. The existence of A. gracilipes within this landscape's intact environments containing highly competitive ant communities indicates that biotic resistance is not a terminally inhibitory factor mediating this ant's distribution at the regional scale. We test whether biotic resistance may still operate at a more local scale by assessing whether ecological impacts are proportional to habitat suitability for A. gracilipes, as well as to the competitiveness of the invaded ant community. The abundance and species richness of native ants were consistently greater in uninfested than infested plots but the magnitude of the impacts did not differ between habitats. The abundance and ordinal richness of other macro-invertebrates were consistently lower in infested plots in all habitats. A significant negative relationship was found for native ant abundance and A. gracilipes abundance. No relationships were found between A. gracilipes abundance and any measure of other macro-invertebrates. The relative contribution of small ants (< 2.5 mm) to total abundance and relative species richness was always greater in infested sites coinciding with a reduction of the contribution of the larger size classes. Differences in the relative abundance of ant functional groups between infested and uninfested sites reflected impacts according to ant size classes and ecology. The widespread scale of these incursions and non-differential level of impacts among the habitats, irrespective of native ant community competitiveness and abiotic suitability to A. gracilipes, does not support the biotic resistance hypothesis."
